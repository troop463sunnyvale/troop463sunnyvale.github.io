                James</p>
              <p> Since the last Court of Honor, the Shark Patrol has been very 
                busy. A lot of the Sharks have either gotten or have come close 
                to earning a rank. At this Court of Honor, Bryant Look will be 
                receiving his Life rank, which is the rank right before Eagle. 
                We have also gotten two new scouts, Tod and Chris. They have already 
                received their Scout badges and I&#146;m very excited to see how 
                quickly they will advance to the next rank. Since A.J. Jones and 
                Alexander Tan received their Tenderfoot ranks last Court of Honor, 
                they will not get a rank this time. Both of them have gotten many 
                requirements signed off and should be getting at least their Second 
                Class ranks really soon. Unfortunately not everything has been 
                good since the last Court of Honor. One of our scouts Jake Persischetty 
                has unfortunately left our troop. If he stayed here longer, I 
                know he would have become a very good scout and eventually a good 
                leader for this troop. I know the Shark Patrol wishes him the 
                best of luck in his new troop. I hope all of you earn many requirements 
                and earn you Eagle ranks quickly</p>

              Derek</p>
            <p>The Falcons are ahead of the game. We are managing to stay ahead 
              of competition in all respects, except through the leadership&#146;s 
              advancement. In competition we dominate, in attendance we are just 
              above or so it seems. In younger scout advancement compared to the 
              sharks there is some controversy. Overall the Falcons are soaring 
              high. The patrol is becoming more spirited than before. The only 
              things standing in our way for honor patrol are the occasional major 
              advancements of the Sharks that cannot be avoided.<br>
              Overall the advancement of this patrol is progressing increasingly 
              in skill and knowledge. They are learning quickly and only need 
              to learn to cooperate more efficiently with the older scouts. If 
              the scouts put a little more effort in I&#146;m sure that would 
              make a tremendous difference, not that they aren&#146;t already 
              doing great.</p>

              11/10-12/01<br>
              Brian</p>
            <p>The November outing was a backpacking trip to Portola Redwoods 
              State Park. It was a whole lot of fun. We backpacked in about five 
              miles to our wonderful camp in the redwoods. We then had lunch, 
              followed by a day hike up to a ridge down the trail a little past 
              our camp. The hike was a little odd since on the way some of us 
              played a game of risk. When we got to the ridge, it started raining 
              and continued forever (about one minute). After returning from our 
              day hike, we played risk some more and hung out around camp. We 
              played with our ultra-cool light-up footballs, even as it got dark. 
              <br>
              The next day our group, Mr. Thurgate, Mr. Ho, Mr. Lind, myself, 
              James, David, Eric, Alex, and Karl, split up, since David and Alex 
              needed to go home for school the next day and Mr. Ho needed to drive 
              them home. The rest of us went on a day hike to a nearby river and 
              redwood grove. The hike went well and was a lot of fun. We were 
              hiking through a beautiful redwood forest, which, partly due to 
              the rain the day before and the clouds, was very moist. It drizzled 
              a little on the hike, but for the most part it was just cloudy or 
              once in a while, it was even sunny! The trail ended in a mile loop 
              and after finishing this, we had lunch next to the river by a huge 
              fallen redwood. Upon getting back to camp, we once again hung out, 
              and played catch. <br>
              The following morning we had a very . . . uh interesting breakfast. 
              Karl and Eric refused to try it, so James and I got to eat a lot 
              of our chocolate pancakes. Although they weren&#146;t the best, 
              they were still pretty </p>

            <p align="left">good. After a late start, we packed up and hiked out 
              in the rain. It was very wet, but still a neat experience. We got 
              to the road slightly off from where we had intended, but that was 
              no problem for it wasn&#146;t far along the road to the car. The 
              storm that we were in was apparently so strong that it had knocked 
              out a tree, which took out a power line. Shortly after passing around 
              this obstacle, we arrived back at the car and drove the short distance 
              home, concluding our best backpack trip of the year (also our only 
              but it would have been the best anyway).</p>

              Bryant</p>
            <p>Hey everybody! This is what will probably be my LAST OA REPORT!!! 
              Why, you ask? Well, your friendly OA rep is moving on to bigger, 
              better things- patrol leader. Then again, there are only four OA 
              members- occupying the positions of patrol leader, SPL, ASPL, and 
              JASM; someone&#146;s got to go to those meetings. Since each of 
              our OA members are invaluable to our troop (don&#146;t deny it!), 
              it will be hard to find someone to go to these clandestine OA meetings. 
              So who, then, will go? Weellll- if we had more 1st Class scouts 
              *hint hint*&#133;which you have to be to be eligible for OA&#133;then 
              our problem would be solved. So to our many young scouts- get 1st 
              Class ASAP!!! In other OA news&#133;everyone at OA is working hard 
              for the upcoming camporee&#133;so everyone train hard for it&#133;also; 
              I helped out with Troop 466 OA elections&#133;our troop&#146;s elections 
              will be here soon! The bottom line: get 1st Class- and if you have 
              it, run for OA! </p>

              12/22/01<br>
              David</p>
            <p>For my service project, and this December outing, we went to the 
              Giving Tree to sort gifts for needy children during the holiday 
              season. It was pretty fun, although the staff clearly had way too 
              many volunteers (which was probably good for them, but they were 
              sometimes overwhelmed and couldn&#146;t find enough things for us 
              to do). The warehouse was big and gray concrete - dusty, too. But 
              inside, there were thousands and thousands and thousands of ultra-neat 
              toys. We moved stuff around and put various things in various places. 
              Since our shift was one of the last in the season, we also cleaned 
              up. In fact, since sweeping was not an option because of the fine 
              dustiness, we had to pick up a bunch of pieces of Styrofoam. <br>
              One of the funnier incidents started when they told us to move these 
              carts into a corner. There was a bag of toys in the corner. We didn&#146;t 
              want to move the bag, because we thought, &#147;Hey, it&#146;s there 
              for a reason. Better not disturb it&#133;&#148; We didn&#146;t think 
              of it for the rest of the time, but then some firefighters came 
              in and asked for the bag of toys marked with their fire department&#146;s 
              name, so that they could distribute it to the kids in their area. 
              Everyone searched all over the warehouse, but nobody could find 
              it. Then, we looked in the corner. And, sure enough, the fire department&#146;s 
              bag of toys was there. They thanked us profusely. Funniness indeed.<br>
              At the end, the organizer/coordinator person gave a speech. It turns 
              out she had only started the Giving Tree as a college project, but 
              it expanded hugely in only a few years. She took wishes from children 
              and put them on trees that she had set up around the Bay </p>

              a few children, but each year, she dreamt a little bigger dream, 
              and now her organization serves tens of thousands of children - 
              a very inspiring story.</p>

            <p> The last two years, I have had the pleasure of being in charge 
              of what I like to think of as one of the best and most fun outings 
              you will ever go on with the troop. This is a very relaxing car 
              camping trip, where you can get many important cooking requirements 
              done. On this trip, we had James Melendez and Alexander Tan who 
              tried to get their cooking requirements signed off, along with many 
              other requirements. Other than just getting requirements signed 
              off, we saw many animals like deer and other animals. If you just 
              want to have fun, they also have some big fields that you can play 
              football on. One thing that we have done the past couple of years 
              is a service project. This year, we filled up holes with wood chips. 
              The holes were formed by trees that the park rangers needed to chop 
              down. It was a lot of fun and we will probably do something like 
              this for years to come. If you ask anybody the one thing that makes 
              this one of the best trips, it is the archery range. You get to 
              shoot at many targets at various distances and in many environments. 
              The one target that is a favorite to all of us, has to be one that 
              you shoot at a target from 60 yards away while you are at the top 
              of this hill. Even though you are bound to lose many arrows, it 
              is a lot of </p>

                arrows you get this feeling that you have done something special.

              <p align="left">West is the day when most troops show off their 
                capabilities to impress scouts so to recruit them into the troop. 
                This helps the troop grow and our troop needs it. This year West 
                went particularly well. We had an unusually large bunch of scouts 
                interested. We had a new asset to our capabilities represented 
                this year. We had a sort of camp set up and cooking equipment 
                used to show we provide all necessary utensils for camping. We 
                also let Scouts roast marshmallows, which they enjoyed. <br>
                We all arrived early to prepare for the Webelos. It was difficult 
                to set everything up and it all needed constant maintenance. It 
                took awhile to get it right, but in the end it worked out. However 
                the camp was not our main attraction. We of coarse had displayed 
                a remarkable Monkey Bridge. It was over 60 feet long and from 
                5 to 10 feet high. A monkey bridge is constructed of two A-frame 
                structures and a lot of rope. <br>
                At West we provided food and pictures of past troop activities, 
                such as summer camping and outings, backpack trips and High Adventure 
                pictures. At West, </p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>we are able to entertain the Webelos 
              and catch the attention of their parents. At West, the scouts showed 
              all the Webelos around and spotted them while on the Monkey Bridge. 
              We cooked for them and socialized with them and made them feel welcome. 
              We let them know some details of our troop and showed them how our 
              troop worked. Over all it was a big success and we may be looking 
              forward to possibly doubling our troop next year. </p>

            <p>My service project was split into two portions; the first was in 
              the fundraising for habitat, which was a race. The second, I spent 
              almost 8 hours working on one of the houses the fundraising had 
              brought money in for. The first portion of my service was in the 
              Stanford College area. <br>
              There were two races, a 10-kilometer and then 5-kilometer run around 
              the Stanford Stadium in about 2-kilometer radius. There were about 
              20 teams competing in this event, most of who gave donations to 
              habitat and paid their entry fees for the race. I helped to set 
              up the race in the morning for about forty minutes. The race began 
              a couple hours later when I was posted on a corner of the course 
              to direct the runners in the correct direction in which the course 
              was headed. I was supposed to cheer the runners on at the same time. 
              This was only to last a maximum of 20 minutes even though I was 
              out there for at least 2 hours. <br>

              <p align="left">there was a shortage of volunteers going on the 
                course to direct the runners. After that, I was picked up and 
                brought back to the stadium. There the awards were given out and 
                I helped to pack up the booth and advertisement equipment for 
                Silicone Light Machines. <br>
                For the second portion of my service hours, I was at the Campbell 
                work site off the corner of Campbell and Victor Rds. The Silicon 
                Valley Habitat of Humanity chapter of Santa Clara County sponsored 
                this site. These habitat groups are working to raise the level 
                of living in areas of the les fortunate. After a family is chosen, 
                they must work at least 500 hours on the house to earn it. If 
                the family does this, they have no interest mortgage rates. The 
                family is then able to rise into a better life style. With no 
                big tax on their house, they can afford more food and clothing. 
                <br>
                It was really remarkable to be with some of those family members 
                working on their house. They really try to work their hardest 
                on the house. I believe some of them are so eager to build the 
                house they put way more than just 500 hours into the houses. The 
                teenagers of the families work on it every day they can after 
                school and on the weekends. I talked with a couple of them and 
                they believe this will be the best thing that will affect their 
                lives to the greatest extent. <br>
                The houses were made up to have one bathroom, three bedrooms, 
                a washroom, and a kitchen and living room/dining room. The windows 
                would face south, west, and east. There are four houses in this 
                one site all being built next to each other. Each house is built 
                virtually the same, in three sections. The east section is the 
                living/dining room, the upper northwest is the bedrooms, the middle 
                west is the kitchen and wash room, and the southwest is the bathroom 
                and one more bedroom. <br>
                My jobs at the site were varied from soldering the plumbing system 
                together to helping to install the floor insulation. It was cold 
                in the morning, which made the welding hard. It was all about 
                speed and efficiency. In the cold, it made it harder to do this. 
                I was to get underneath some boards and torch a copper pipe after 
                it had been &#145;fluxed&#146; or had a sticky acid applied to 
                it to clean the copper for a clean soldering job. (The acid was 
                weak, but still burned when in contact with the skin). Once heated, 
                the solder was applied, if done right the combined tube joint 
                would suck in the melted solder</p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>in a form of vacuum. The heat had to 
              be applied right or the solder would become messy. The joint was 
              then sprayed and wiped down. This work was not that difficult and 
              after some time I got to be rather exceptional at it. Lots of obstacles 
              would come as to how the piping was to be placed. My supervisor 
              would be mistaken once in a while and we would have to go back and 
              undo a couple of joints. It had to be perfect.<br>
              After work on the tubing was done, the insulation crew needed some 
              help and I decided to give it a try. Insulation installation was 
              less demanding than I had first figured. The process was easy; I 
              later learned that this was a new style of insulation installation. 
              First the crew took black plastic netting and stapled it to the 
              southwestern edge of the house. It was rolled up to the eastern 
              edge. The netting was a bed for the installation in between the 
              floor support boards. The netting was spread loosely between the 
              boards and the insulation laid in it. The netting was then stapled 
              to each board. This netting kind of installation is much easier 
              than someone having to go underneath it and staple it there. The 
              insulation had to fill up every crevice of the floor and had to 
              be cut around all sorts of tubes poking up and the netting stapled 
              around these things. After a while, this process became very annoying. 
              Other than that, the installation is made of fibers of fiberglass 
              and is very itchy when gets on your skin and in your pours. Everyone 
              was itching at the end of this.<br>
              At the end of the day the pipes of the first house were testes by 
              air pressure to see if there were any leaks. It turned out to have 
              a slow leak. The crew then went around to each of the soldered connections 
              and sprayed them one by one with soap. They found one cause of the 
              leak in a joint that had been done by someone the day before. The 
              soap is used to cover any hole in the bond and if the air pressure 
              is leaking out there, then the soap will form bubbles. <br>
              I found most of this work to be satisfying seeing how much the houses 
              had progressed in just one day made it look like they may be done 
              in a matter of months. The hardest part for me was to lie across 
              skinny boards to reach the middle of the netting to staple. I rather 
              enjoyed this experience almost as much as going to Mexico to build 
              much more crude houses in four days.</p>
