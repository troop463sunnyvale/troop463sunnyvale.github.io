              <p align="left">On May 11 and 12, I held my Eagle project to build 
                owl boxes. These boxes were designed and built for Western Screech 
                Owls. The boxes were then delivered on May 26 to rangers at Hellyer 
                County Park. The rangers there will place the boxes in trees. 
                Along with the placement, the rangers will also place placards 
                on the boxes designating them as the work of our troop.</p>

              <p align="left">The owls, though not endangered, have had their 
                numbers reduced by the explosion of housing development in the 
                area. Area parks, such as Hellyer, are essentially the only area 
                where these birds can find homes. These owls don&#146;t make nests 
                of their own but instead steal the nests of other birds to make 
                their </p>

              multiple species. Since the boxes are premade and ready for habitation, 
              the owls will be able to move right in. <br>
              On the first day of the project several scouts and parents measured 
              and cut the wood to designed lengths to prepare for actual construction. 
              The second day, several more scouts came and, after some instruction, 
              built the boxes. Using drills, screwdrivers, and saws, the scouts 
              and parents built 15 boxes.<br>
              Overall I think the project was a complete success. Mr. Young, my 
              contact with the county, was very pleased with the boxes and was 
              grateful for the help. The scouts enjoyed themselves, and with the 
              help of some pizzas brought for lunch, finished the project ahead 
              of schedule.</p>
            <p align="left">I would like to thank all of the scouts and adults 
              who participated. Without their help I would never have been able 
              to get this done.</p>

            <p align="center">Building Houses in Mexico<br>
              By Eric</p>
            <p>On April 14, 1 went with a group of people from Los Altos United 
              Methodist Church to build houses in Mexico. We stayed that night 
              in San Diego, crossing into Mexico on Sunday. We set up camp at 
              a site provided by AMOR Ministries, the organization that arranges 
              for the house building. The campsite was a dusty rock quarry on 
              the outskirts of Tijuana.<br>
              For the next four days, I worked with a team of 20 people building 
              a small, two-room house. The house had a slab floor, a slant roof, 
              two doors and two windows. Everyone, including me, helped with all 
              phases of the house building. That included: scraping the ground 
              to prepare for the foundation, digging a trench to stabilize the 
              slab, mixing and pouring the cement, assembling and installing the 
              walls and roof. We also nailed on tarpaper </p>
          </td>
          <td width="49%" valign="top"> 
            <p align="left">and chicken wire in preparation for stucco. We were 
              only able to apply one layer of stucco, leaving the supplies for 
              the house owner to complete. The owner was better at applying the 
              stucco anyway.</p>
            <p align="left">The family we built the house for consisted of parents 
              and 4 children. They were very grateful for the new house. The house 
              that they were in before consisted of plywood sheets nailed together. 
              On Friday we returned to San Diego and flew home.</p>

              James</p>
            <p> The newly formed Shark patrol had a lot of fun at the Camporee. 
              We competed against other troops in events like A-frame relay, orienteering, 
              and first aid. We received an Award of Merit and Honor at Camporee. 
              I think we learned a lot of useful skills and next year we hope 
              to win 1st or 2nd place.<br>
              This year has been a busy year with all the changes. The new Shark 
              patrol consists of Jake, A.J., Michael, Brian, Alex, Simon, and 
              Bryant and me, James. I haven&#146;t scheduled many patrol meetings 
              since the creation of this patrol so we haven&#146;t been working 
              on many requirements, which are needed for advancement. Next year, 
              I hope to schedule patrol meetings, at least once a month to help 
              everybody progress in their ranks. I hope the &#147;Sharks&#148; 
              are having fun and learning a lot of useful skills. There are a 
              lot of exciting outings planned for next year. I hope all of you 
              will be able to attend summer camp this year is at Marin Sierra. 
              It&#146;s a lot of fun and you can earn merit badges there. Some 
              of the merit badges are only available at camp, so check over your 
              list and have fun choosing the ones you would like to attend. I 
              hope to see all you there. I have one favor to ask all of you, if 
              we all cooperate and work as a team we can be the &#147;Best Patrol&#148;

            <p>At the camporee, there was good news, and there was bad news. First 
              of all, thanks to a wonderful flyer, we had near perfect attendance, 
              which is (almost) unheard of on this outing! (well, not really, 
              but it makes me look good if I say that) We even got a few Webelos 
              to come with us. That was a good thing; not only did they get introduced 
              to their friendly, caring, guiding patrols, and see the fun, exciting, 
              competitive environment of the camporee for their very first outing, 
              but, on a side note, ourpatrolsalsogotextrapointsforthem. (Of course, 
              that was not a reason at all why we wanted them to come with us&#133; 
              no really&#133;) Moving right along, another good thing was that 
              we got (almost) all of the points for the campsite inspection, another 
              first in our troop&#146;s history (um&#133; kinda); the only place 
              in which we lost points was &#147;distinct patrol areas!&#148; Thanks 
              to the patrol leaders, James and Derek, and our quartermaster, Karl, 
              we had all of the stuff we needed, including a flagpole, posted 
              duty rosters and menus, signs saying &#147;No Flames In Tent,&#148; 
              buckets full of water and dirt, a first aid tent (in which, incidentally, 
              the leadership people played cards afterwards), and, of course, 
              the official bribes &#150; patrols got 4 points for each can of 
              soda they brought for the staff. On to the bad news: the only piece 
              of bad news was that, in the actual competitions, we didn&#146;t 
              do as explosively spectacularly enormously fantastically outstandingly 
              amazingly fabulously incredibly extremely tremendously staggeringly 
              resplendently gloriously brilliantly well as we had hoped. (I love 
              the thesaurus :) However, we did do well for a troop with a high 
              percentage of newer scouts, some of them having only three meetings 
              to learn the necessary skills! Therefore, we were not disappointed, 
              since we were competing against some patrols full of older scouts; 
              next year, we can expect to do very well when all of our new </p>

              <p align="left">In April, we went on a backpacking trip to Point 
                Reyes. We left home on Friday and drove to the trailhead where 
                we arrived at around nine. We hiked into Skycamp with a lot of 
                fog and with it quite dark. Friday night, we simply set up camp 
                and either played cards, talked, or went to sleep. We awoke the 
                following morning at around 7:30 and had breakfast. Over two hours 
                later, we were on our way from Skycamp. It was about six miles 
                to Coastcamp where we&#146;d spend Saturday night. After about 
                a mile of backpacking, we set down our packs and climbed MT. Wittenberg. 
                The view from the top wasn&#146;t very good because of a lot of 
                smaller trees along the top. However a little ways from the top 
                of the peak, there was a pretty good view of the ocean so we stopped 
                here to have the new scouts work on compass skills.<br>
                We hiked another few hours from MT. Wittenberg, to Coastcamp. 
                It was extremely windy at Coastcamp where we ate lunch. After 
                finishing lunch we took a walk on the beach, where we went to 
                Sculpture Beach, a very cooooooooooool area. There were many small 
                caves and arches, and even some large arches. We spent a few hours 
                here playing in the sand and water. We then walked back to camp 
                to have dinner.<br>
                Sunday we awoke at around seven, so that we could get to Sculpture 
                Beach at low tide, so we could go further. We went under two arches 
                to get to another beach area. Off of the beach there was the neatest 
                area, a small opening in the cliff, which led to a huge opening

              <p align="left">The Leadership Outing was held on March 24 and 25.&nbsp;The 
                outing was for scouts with leadership roles in the troop only.&nbsp; 
                The main idea of the outing was how the troop could become better 
                leaders.<br>
                Over the course of the outing the scouts discussed what it meant 
                to be a leader in a variety of subjects.&nbsp;They did this by 
                conducting classes in which one of the scouts taught the others 
                about a particular part of leadership. The scouts were suposed 
                to do research on their topic to present during the leadership 
                outing. Also on this outing was the Patrol Leaders Conference. 
                Held once a month by the leaders of the&nbsp; troop, the conference 
                is a meeting where the plans for the next month&#146;s troop meetings 
                are set.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="Images/newsletter/n%20football.JPG" width="73" height="63"></p>
              <p align="left">In all, the outing was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Probably 
                the best part for the scouts was the fact that the adults cooked 
                the food. As per tradition, the scouts have to do no cooking on 
                the Leadership Outing.&nbsp; Also, several games of football were 
                played with other troops staying in the area.<br>
                The scouts learned a lot about leadership, which should help them 
                with guiding the troop for the next year.</p>

              showed us the basics of cross-country skiing, we put our packs on 
              and started off towards the campsite.<br>
              After a couple hours of cross-country skiing through deep powder, 
              we stopped for lunch. It was getting late in the afternoon and we 
              wanted to set up camp soon. We didn&#146;t think we could make it 
              to our planned campsite. Luckily just around the next turn we came 
              upon a satisfactory spot. We decided that our snow caves would have 
              a common entrance and each of us would have his own &#145;room&#146; 
              which branched off from that. We spent the next couple hours creating 
              the structure. Finally it was time to have dinner. After dinner 
              we all went to bed except for me, because I froze all night. The 
              floor of my snow cave was slanted and I kept sliding into the corner 
              where I got wet.<br>
              In the morning after breakfast we put on our daypacks and skied 
              2-3 miles to a lookout point where we had lunch. Unfortunately the 
              fog obscured the view and we could see only about 100 yards. After 
              lunch we skied back to our campsite. We spent another couple of 
              hours refining our snow caves because during the night they had 
              begun to cave in. After dinner we went to bed.<br>
              The next morning after breakfast we donned our packs and skied back 
              to the car. It was challenging because it was snowing so hard that 
              I could barely see Brian&#146;s tracks and he was only a couple 
              minutes in front of me! After we reached the car, we practiced on 
              our cross-country skiing form and went home.</p>
