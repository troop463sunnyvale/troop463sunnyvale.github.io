      <p align="center">Wolverine Patrol<br>
        James</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we formed the Wolverine Patrol in March, we have 
        been able to accomplish a lot. There are two scouts who have earned the 
        rank of Scout, Matthew P and Sean P. All of the other Wolverines have 
        also been working very hard. They have all shown up to the troop meetings, 
        some of the outings, and even the one patrol meeting that I was able to 
        schedule. Even if they don&#146;t receive their rank by the next court 
        of honor, they are very close to obtaining it. Since many requirements 
        can be done on the outings, all of you should try to attend and go to 
        the senior scouts for sign offs. Just a reminder for everyone in my patrol, 
        when you come to the meetings, please bring your scout books. If you have 
        any questions, you can ask me during the meetings or give me a call. If 
        you want a requirement signed off, I will try to set up a patrol meeting 
        or a separate day when we can get together&#133; you just have to ask! 
        I would like to see all of you finish your 30 days of exercises for Tenderfoot 
        (very soon), and give me a call for the sign off. Have fun over the summer, 
        and I will see you next fall, or maybe at Summer Camp.</p>

      <p>Well, a lot has changed since the last Court of Honor, that&#146;s for

        enthusiastic Scouts around, as well as a sometimes helpful (haha) Quartermaster, 
        AJ. One of our new scouts, Curtis, (and his parents I might add) built 
        our awesome new flag, which we took to Camporee. Our patrol did relatively 
        well at Camporee, seeing as it was everyone&#146;s first time competing 
        against other troops, and that they hadn&#146;t learned most of the skills. 
        Most of the new scouts have been working hard to get a rank, a few are 
        very close to Tenderfoot and only a couple have not gotten Scout rank 
        yet. I hope to see everyone in the patrol get Tenderfoot by the COH after 
        the one coming up. Well, that&#146;s all, enjoy summer camp!</p>

      <p align="center">Flaming Waffles<br>
        Daniel</p>
      <p>This is the first time that I have written an article about my patrol 
        for this paper, but that is not surprising because this is the first time 
        that I have had a patrol to write an article about. The Flaming Waffles 
        (don&#146;t ask) came into being about 2 months ago when the troop grew 
        by about one and a half times its size. The troop acquired two new patrols 
        and two new patrol leaders. One of these new patrol leaders was me. The 
        Flaming Waffles patrol (really don&#146;t ask) now consists of Chris, 
        Todd, Edward, Nathan, Spencer, Monet, Cameron and myself. It has been 
        interesting being a patrol leader but the boys are a lot of fun and very 
        enthusiastic and I can only see good times in the future. We have gone 
        on several campouts as a patrol and, even though it rained heavily at 
        Del Val, people were still enthusiastic enough to come on the most recent 
        trip to the Yuba River which was really a blast. Well, that&#146;s the 
        end of this article for the Flaming Waffles (I mean it about not asking. 
        I don&#146;t even know) you&#146;ll hear from me again in the spring, 
        So Long!</p>

      <p align="center">Blank Patrol<br>
        David</p>
      <p>&#133; [ leader ] &#133; Hi everyone, this is David Ho, patrol leader 
        of the totally elite Blank Patrol. Of DooOOoOm!!! Well, these past few 
        months have been quite an experience for me as a leader. I started out 
        as patrol leader of the Dragons years and years ago, then became ASPL, 
        then SPL, then JASM, and now, hey look, I&#146;m patrol leader again! 
        =) I&#146;m finding that patrol leader is, without a doubt, the hardest 
        leadership position&#133; I missed a few meetings, which was not so good 
        (it&#146;s a much bigger commitment than SPL), and I had to relearn a 
        few things about being Patrol Leader that I&#146;d forgotten. However, 
        at the end of this leadership rotation, I feel that I&#146;ve learned 
        to lead better than ever before, and that I&#146;m able to apply many 
        of the lessons I&#146;ve learned about leadership from my entire career 
        in Boy Scouts.</p>
      <p>&#133; [ teamwork ] &#133; Even with experience, though, nothing works 
        out perfectly in the beginning. Little kids will be little kids, so of 
        course there was quite a bit more goofing off and quite a bit less focusing 
        than I would have liked at first. But as time passed, with more meetings 
        and more outings, we functioned more and more as a patrol, whether it 
        was during a skills instruction at a meeting, during a cleanup at an outing, 
        or during a competition at the Camporee.</p>
      <p>&#133; [ kids ] &#133; Now on to the scouts themselves. In no particular 
        order, they are: James M., Jordan, Chris S., Aaron, Erich, Benjamin, and 
        Nick. And wow. They are amazing. I was incredibly imp</p>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <p align="left">pressed by their dedication to advancement. These guys took 
        initiative and worked hard on their own, and it clearly paid off for them, 
        as you can tell from the Court of Honor. I couldn&#146;t ask for any better 
        group of scouts for my return to a position as Patrol Leader.</p>
      <p align="left">&#133; [ events ] &#133; We did awesomely at the Camporee. 
        Although in the previous meetings we weren&#146;t focused in the competitions, 
        everyone pulled together and busted out some massive teamwork at the Camporee, 
        and we basically owned =P. I was amazed at how suddenly everyone became 
        cohesive and spirited (and of course they were always skilled). We got 
        a red ribbon, meaning we beat more than 1/3 of the patrols there, even 
        though we had brand new scouts and most of the other patrols were much 
        more experienced than we were. Furthermore, we won 1st place in Spider 
        Web thanks to our cooperation, enthusiasm, and unique patrol yell =D. 
        Back at camp, everything worked out all right with setting up tents, cooking, 
        cleaning, etc. Except that it took forever. Cleanup was horrendously inefficient; 
        we took hours longer than we should have. But it was ok, and we came out 
        confident that we are just clearly superior =). On the backpacking trip, 
        we had a smaller group than we had on the Camporee, but it was still pretty 
        good. The 3-mile hike in wasn&#146;t too bad, and even though all three 
        of the scouts who came (Aaron, Benjamin, and Nick) were completely new 
        scouts, they managed to keep up. The site was pretty beautiful when we 
        got there; canopy of trees, cliff overlooking a river, etc&#133; In between 
        setting up, cooking, cleaning, and stuff, we played cards, went down to 
        the river, and did advancement. The only problem was the mosquito bites. 
        We all got like 5238795238909082579864706187091 mosquito bites. That wasn&#146;t 
        fun at all. But besides that, everyone survived, so it was all right in 
        the end.</p>

        <p>SPL Corner<br>
          By Brian</p>
        <p align="left">Hello, for those of you who don&#146;t know me (where 
          have you been?), I&#146;m Brian your SPL (Senior Patrol Leader.) I&#146;m 
          very happy to be your SPL in what promises to be the best year since 
          long before any of us, who are currently in the troop, can remember. 
          It has been very exciting lately, since in under a month our troop size 
          has doubled. Although this poses many challenges for the senior patrol, 
          especially your patrol leaders, we are very excited about it. It is 
          going to be hard to get going given the lack of scouts with experience, 
          but if you hang in, pay attention, and show a desire to learn, we will 
          progress greatly and soon those of you who just joined will be leading.</p>
        <p align="left">At this time, I would like to mention a few things about 
          the way our troop works for those of you who are new. First of all, 
          this troop is led by us, the scouts, not the adults. The adults help 
          us, advise us, give us suggestions, and drive us places, but this is 
          our troop. We make the decisions, we plan the meetings, and for the 
          most part, the senior scouts teach and sign things off. This is important 
          because it allows the troop to be easily shaped by us. If you have ideas 
          to enhance the troop meeting, want to learn something new, or have a 
          complaint, tell us. We will be able to do something about it, even if 
          it is simply explain why it is that way, it will help. You never know, 
          maybe your idea will be a new idea and we&#146;ll adopt it. Another 
          thing is that the troop meetings are dependent on you. The senior scouts 
          waste, I mean spend, fifteen minutes before and after each meeting, 
          as well as an hour and a half one Sunday a month, as well as all the 
          time it takes to get ready, to </p>
        </div>
    </td>
    <td valign="middle"> 
      <div align="center"> 
        <p align="left">plan the troop meetings. However, it still depends on 
          you for them to be successful. If you mess around, say stupid random 
          things, don&#146;t pay attention, or choose not to ask a question because 
          you are afraid to or don&#146;t want to learn you waste your time, your 
          fellow scouts&#146; time, the senior scouts&#146; time, the adult leaders 
          time, and your parents time. Another thing is the uniform. I didn&#146;t 
          make it nor did any of the senior scouts but it still exists, and is 
          the way it is. Could they have made it more comfortable or look cooler? 
          Sure. Did they? No, it is the way it is. However, you still must wear 
          it. Way too many people come with no uniform or a partial uniform. This 
          is hurting your chances of getting Honor patrol, and it just makes you 
          look bad. Also when you do wear it, it means nothing if it is untucked, 
          unbuttoned, badgeless, or otherwise not right. We represent Boy Scouts. 
          Lets dress for the occasion. I know some of these things may seem unpopular 
          to you, but that&#146;s the way it works.</p>
        <p align="left">Finally, I&#146;d like to talk a little about advancement. 
          First, I want to tell you my view of advancement, it means NOTHING. 
          Now before you ask &#147;then why are you guys always bugging us about 
          it?&#148; let me explain myself. Advancement is just a token, it says 
          that you know these skills; the important part is KNOWING them. If you 
          know everything you need to get First Class, in my eyes you have First 
          Class. It is just a formality of going to a senior scout and getting 
          it signed off, which I feel you should do since that is how we know 
          that you know something. In Boy Scouts, unlike Cub Scouts, you are responsible 
          for advancement, your parents or friends or Patrol leader can&#146;t 
          do it for you. We will all try to help you get advanced but when it 
          comes down to it, it&#146;s all up to you. This doesn&#146;t mean you 
          have to do it on your own, all you need to do is show initiative and 
          we will help you do the best for you. In closing, I would first like 
          to apologize for the lecture, I&#146;m not sure it was entirely necessary, 
          but hopefully it will help. Like I said earlier, I expect this to be 
          an outstanding year; hopefully you will all impress me with how quickly 
          you get rank and learn new things. It should be a great year, and I 
          will see you all around, and hopefully learn all of your names before 
          I&#146;m no longer SPL!</p>

      <p align="left">This years&#146; JLT was at Lake Del Valle, near Livermore. 
        For all of you who don&#146;t know what a JLT is, I will tell you. This 
        is a once a year, overnight camping outing, where the senior scouts (First 
        Class and above) get together to learn teaching skills, and plan future 
        outings. We decided on the outings for next year. During this years&#146; 
        JLT, we also learned how to work with all you young scouts. Before you 
        joined our troop, we had only about half as many scouts as we do now. 
        We learned how to handle, teach, and sign off requirements for larger 
        groups of people. To help us accomplish this, we decided to make a box 
        containing everything one may need to get requirements signed off. We 
        will bring this box on some outings, so no matter where we go, we will 
        have the equipment easily accessible for you to use. You should try to 
        get to First Class as soon as you can, so you can join us. We also had 
        a little free time to play volleyball with some of the other people camping 
        near us. The adults cook for us on this outing, too. If any parents have 
        any suggestions for future outings, or anything else, please let us know, 
        via the committee meetings. As you know, it is held on the second Thursday 
        of each month (on weeks when scout meetings are scheduled). The senior 
        scouts are looking forward to using their skills to help the younger scouts 
        have fun and advance. Remember, they will soon be our future leaders</p>

      <p align="left">Although many of you have flown in an airplane before, how 
        many have actually flown a plane? At the Hiller Aviation Museum in San 
        Carlos, some of us scouts were able to fly in a private plane&#133; a 
        few were even able to fly the plane, momentarily. We went up in small 
        groups of about 3 to 4 people. Once up in the sky, we were able to get 
        a magnificent view of the surrounding cities and terrain. Flying was only 
        a small part of our visit. After we were all once again on the ground, 
        we started our tour of the museum. There were many different types of 
        planes, from the earliest biplanes to the recent jets of today. We also 
        received an unexpected treat. Several interesting speakers were in attendance 
        and talked about books they wrote and planes in general. Before leaving, 
        we were able to go to the gift shop for some neat souvenirs. This was 
        a very fun and educational outing for all who attended.</p>

        suffering through a Boy Scout outing! Soon however, they realized we would 
        go camping anyway, and a little later we had a new plan, we&#146;d simply 
        camp at Grant Ranch and we could still have a fun outing. So we loaded 
        up, drove up on the long windy road which afforded some nice views of 
        the bay area . . . o, wait a minute, its raining, I take back the view 
        part. Anyway we got up to our destination, checked with the ranger and 
        we got two sites. Unfortunately, the group sites were closed due to lack 
        of water (don&#146;t ask, I know it was raining, and I know we had planned 
        on going to a place with only 1 car and which was miles away from water.) 
        We went in search of two sites that would work and, you guessed it, we 
        couldn&#146;t find one. But the campout must go on so we racked our brains 
        and decided to go to Del Valle instead. Back down the windy road we drove, 
        then back on the highway and a little over an hour later, Del Valle, and 
        the end to our interesting drive (I&#146;d like to note here that I </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <p align="left">wasn&#146;t driving so it wasn&#146;t my fault the drive 
        took so long, I mean that was probably the longest drive we&#146;ll ever 
        take to get to Del Valle.)<br>
        We got to Del Valle and it wasn&#146;t raining, but it sure looked like 
        it was about to so we set up the dining-flies first. It took a while and 
        by the time we finished, it was raining. After this, we set up the tents. 
        It was highly windy which was annoying since it made the conditions a 
        lot worse than a little rain. After setting up camp, we ate lunch, then 
        pretty much did nothing (we did work on requirements) until dinner. After 
        dinner which was, unfortunately, nearly identical for all the patrols 
        (a tendency of the meals for all outings), some of us played cards, while 
        others slept, while still more enjoyed singing and talking around a campfire. 
        The following morning we got up, ate breakfast, broke camp and went to 
        Taco Bell. It was about the least exciting morning ever due largely to 
        the rain (which most people didn&#146;t mind much) and its amazing power 
        to make home feel so comfortable. After lunch, we returned home and hung 
        out wet things, thus ending many of the new scouts&#146; first campout 
        as Boy Scouts.</p>

      <p>Did we all have to get up before the sun? I think we did, and more, we 
        had to pack everything together, check out last minute equipment, and 
        assemble before we could leave by about 7:30 am. Oh yes, there were items 
        that were forgotten but who can we blame for that? The SPL? Surly there 
        are other explanations for that adversity. However, being the boy scouts 
        that we are, we pulled through, relying solely on our preparedness and 
        the supervising grownups on the trip who happened to be a bit too comfortable 
        and yet quite accommodating.<br>
        The weather couldn&#146;t have been better, or our campsite smaller. One 
        snag in the trip was that our campsite had been mistaken for another. 
        However, we had already completed about half of our setting up, when the 
        mistake had been discovered. So we made do, even if it did take us an 
        extra 2 hours to complete our campsite. The boys however, slowly they 
        got moving did quite well in the neatness that they achieved for the camp 
        inspection.<br>
        The weekend turned out to be a fun and humorous experience for many and 
        generally snag free for the rest of the trip, until the end. I never heard 
        any complaints about the activities and competitions, so I assume that 
        most of the boys had a rather entertaining experience. Now I, the Acting 
        SPL for the Camporee must commend our troop for doing such an excellent 
        job on our competition score. Half of the troop actually made it</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p></p>
      <div align="left"></div>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <p align="left">to the second place level among the entire Camporee competitors. 
        This done with newly recruited scouts many of whom had not achieved even 
        the Scout rank yet, was a brilliant act of spirit, skill, and preparedness. 
        With the experience and training the boys will have by next time, I for 
        one would not be surprised if one patrol made it to a first place level. 
        As well as having a much more enjoyable trip. <br>
        Other than a few brushes with poison oak, I believe that the trip was 
        fairly pain free. We had great meals and spent most of our time preparing 
        or cleaning up from or for those meals. One other activity we participated 
        in was the raising and lowering of the American flag on a Boy Scout built 
        flag pool, to fulfill a rank requirement for many of the newer scouts. 
        <br>
        The last thing I wanted to say is about our departure. We had in effect 
        one of the slowest departures ever. Again there must be some reasonable 
        explanation other than the SPL&#146;s inefficiency to determine why this 
        occurrence only happened on this one trip. We probably spent over half 
        an hour total picking up trash in our attempts to leave the campsite by 
        the Boy Scout code, cleaner then when we had found it. <br>

          This was for many of the new Scouts the first time experiencing the 
          joys of trekking along carrying all your worldly goods on your back. 
          We spent two hours hiking into our campsite. Up and down, passing a 
          beautiful waterfall. The path was surrounded by poison oak - luckily, 
          everyone avoided this. Mr. Enomoto&#146;s tent and a water bottle decided 
          to go for a cooling swim before reaching camp. Only the tent could be 
          persuaded to return. Camp was finally reached in time for lunch - some 
          of the senior Scouts waited an hour for the rest of the group to catch 
          up, only to find that the campsite was just five minutes down the trail!<br>
          On arrival we made camp, had lunch and cooled off in the river. The 
          next day we built a dam across the river and some Scouts went off to 
          follow a hike and compass course. The afternoon was spent signing off 
          requirements.<br>
          On Monday, Memorial Day, we broke camp after breakfast. The hike back 
          was shorter than the hike in but mainly uphill. This was where deficiencies 
          in the fit of backpacks started to show up. At the end of the trail 
          those people with energy remaining explored a tunnel to the river, a 
          left over from the Gold Rush. After that it was time to go home.<br>
          It was a fun weekend, despite the voracious mosquitoes, who found junior 
          Scouts to be especially tasty. The bites marks will disappear eventually</p>

          Kim</p>
        <p align="left">A great big THANK YOU to all of you who helped out at 
          this years Hands on the Arts fundraiser and Camporee. <br>
          The fundraiser was very successful and it was nice to put some new faces 
          with names. I hope everyone had a good time. Between the 2 booths we 
          made just over $1,000.00. This will defiantly help the troop in the 
          purchase of all those new tents we will need come Fall.<br>
          We sold a total of 68 pizzas in the Pizza Booth and sold out of a few 
          of the ice cream choices in the Ice Cream Booth - which helped us sell 
          some of the less popular ice cream items.<br>
          Taking on the extra Pizza Booth this year was a risk that paid us back 
          well. We could not have done it without all of you who kindly gave us 
          between 2 &#150; 6 hrs of your Saturday. Needing so many of you for 
          Hands on the Arts and as drivers or chaperones for Camporee really made 
          for an ALL TROOP commitment. Thank you so much! <br>
          Also a big Thank you to Julie Peatfield who took on the job of Chairperson 
          &#147;in training&#148; for this event. I had a great time working with 
          her and Nancy Skidmore, who is now officially our retired chair for 
          this event. Nancy&#146;s talent, keen organization skills and enthusiasm 
          trained us all well. Thank you Nancy for the many years you gave Troop 
          463 on the Hands on the Arts event and much more! Julie and I will run 
          the event next year. If you had a good time and would like to take on 
          a fun job to support the troop, let me know and we will get you started 
          next year. Julie will need a co-chair on this event in two years.<br>
          Thanks to all of you who made yourself available to help the troop on 
          this busy weekend.</p>

      <p align="center">Scouting Transitions<br>
        Tim</p>
      <p>I would like to welcome our new scouts. I hope you will find Boy Scouts 
        and being in our troop both rewarding and fun. You are making a big transition 
        in going from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts and I thought I would take this 
        opportunity to explain a little of what Boy Scouts is about.<br>
        Obviously, there is much about Boy Scouts that is similar to Cub Scouts 
        and hopefully you will quickly feel at home. There are however, some important 
        differences. You&#146;ll notice that the troop is run by the boys and 
        not the adults. You will also find that you will have to do much more 
        yourselves and that getting requirements signed off and earning rank is 
        up to you. It will not happen unless you make it happen.<br>
        Boy Scouts attempts to help boys in the bigger transition of becoming 
        adults. Its goal is to develop character and create good citizens. To 
        make this process fun, the program is centered on the outdoors. Just as 
        in Cub Scouts, there are ranks to be earned by passing sets of requirements. 
        The requirements for the first three ranks, Tenderfoot, Second Class, 
        and First Class, are for the most part skills and knowledge that are needed 
        to safely enjoy the outdoors - pitching a tent, cooking, map and compass, 
        first aid, knots, lashing, etc. I want to emphasize that the real work 
        of Boy Scouts is not in acquiring the skills themselves, but in the character 
        building that occurs in the process of learning the skills. The scout 
        learns initiative, self reliance, and responsibility. This does not mean 
        that we are not serious about the skills. They are useful to know in and 
        of themselves and we want the scouts to be do their best, not learn how 
        to get by on minimal effort. Ideally, the rank is a symbol that the scout 
        has acquired certain skills, but in practice, </p>
      <p align="center"><br>
      </p>
      </td>
    <td width="49%" valign="top"> 
      <p align="left">it provides the motivation for learning the skills.<br>
        After earning First Class things change somewhat. For the upper three 
        ranks, Star, Life, and Eagle, merit badges are earned to learn the skills. 
        Each merit has its own set of requirements, allowing the topic to be learned 
        in much greater depth. While certain merit badges are required, the scout 
        has large variety to choose from to suite his interests. In addition, 
        the scout also has to perform community service and serve in a leadership 
        position. He now helps run the troop - plans the meetings, chooses the 
        outings, teaches and guides the younger scouts. This is the heart of scouting. 
        The saying the best way to learn is to teach applies to much more than 
        just the skills that are being taught. By being responsible for seeing 
        that the troop functions properly, the scout learns the importance of 
        planning, preparation, respect, discipline, and so on.<br>
        I think the transition to leadership is actually more difficult for the 
        boy than the transition from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts. The transition 
        to Boy Scouts is the more difficult one for the parents. Things are not 
        as organized as when adults ran the pack. And the parent often doesn&#146;t 
        know what is going on since information goes directly to the scouts and 
        mostly stops right there. For the boy, there is the big unknown and corresponding 
        anxiety of going someplace new, but once he is there, it isn&#146;t all 
        that different from what he was doing in Cub Scouts. Of course, being 
        away from home on the first couple of outings can be difficult, especially 
        if it&#146;s the first time. But hopefully he&#146;s having so much fun 
        and the older scouts are helping him through this transition (right guys?!) 
        that its no big deal.<br>
        Changing roles from one of the guys to being a leader is not easy. Almost 
        no one, including the scout himself, recognizes his role as a leader. 
        The current leaders, who have been trying to get him to pay attention 
        and stop goofing off, are not about to delegate any authority to him. 
        And certainly his peers and even younger scouts do not feel they need 
        to do what he says. And yet he has been given the responsibility to carry 
        out some task and is being prodded by his scoutmaster to get it done. 
        This is a slow transition, but eventually if he sticks with it, he moves 
        up through the offices as he moves through the ranks and before you know 
        it he is up in front leading the entire troop.<br>
