            <p align="center">Shark Patrol James</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Hello- This is Bryant, former OA rep 
              and now patrol leader of the Sharks. The last couple of months have 
              been pretty busy, with events like Brian's Eagle Project and the 
              Camporee. I'm happy to say we placed 29th in the Camporee, earning 
              a second place ribbon. Also, several members of our patrol participated 
              in Brian's Eagle Project, contributing semi-valuable hours. Several 
              scouts in the patrol have achieved new ranks and will be recognized 
              at the Court of Honor, next month. Also, Daniel could possibly be 
              joining the Order of the Arrow, which I have talked about numerous 
              times in previous articles. The summer is ahead; the backpacking 
              trip, Hawaii trip (only for 1st Class Scouts and above), and summer 
              camp are all on the troop's to-do-list. That's about it for the 
              Shark's update; I apologize for the lack of witty comments and oh-so-subtle 
              jokes. The reason is, of course, my many hours spent making the 
              patrol flag. (Hey! There's a funny remark!) Note: Patrol members, 
              start thinking up new designs for the flag. Or better yet, MAKE 
              IT YOURSELF! (errr&#133;parental supervision might be good around 
              scissors) This is the Shark's new patrol leader, Bryant Look, signing 
              out&#133; </p>

            <p align="center">Falcon Patrol Derek</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The falcon patrol is settling in with 
              satisfaction, with a few minor changes. The newer scouts are getting 
              used to the practice of the general workings of our Boy Scout system. 
              As you may know, Boy Scouts is a boy run program and I believe that 
              the newer scouts are ready to begin taking on more responsibilities. 
              The hardest thing to get used to is the discipline, it's easy to 
              get carried away, but in time, with responsibility, they will understand. 
              Many of the newer scouts are looking forward to advancing and all 
              they need is little help and that's what the patrol is there for. 
              Along with the new scouts some hope they will bring more creative 
              ways to improve the scout spirit and enhance the fun in our scout 
              troop. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>It is my belief that these new scouts 
              will further improve the patrols motivations and standards in the 
              ongoing rivalry for honor patrol. I hope they learn to work together 
              and help provide encouragement in exchange for advancement to our 
              progressing patrol. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The Falcon Patrol is still continuing 
              to experience change and will make the best of it. I hope the change 
              does not effect the patrols actions too much and I expect a full 
              recovery and advancement to be under pressure. This might mean the 
              budding of patrol meetings. I expect to give our competition a much 
              more challenging opponent. </p>
            <p>Any questions feel free to contact me. </p>
            <p>Best of luck </p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Hi! This is your new Senior Patrol 
              Leader James Enomoto. I was just recently elected and am hoping 
              to help this troop the best I can. We have many young scouts who 
              are really working hard on achieving their ranks. The Senior Patrol 
              has lots of fun and exciting activities planned for this year. We 
              will be covering the many skills needed to obtain your next rank, 
              so please be at every meeting, on time, and bring your book. You 
              can also have your parents work with you at home. If you need extra 
              help on any of these skills, let your Patrol Leader or a Senior 
              Scout know. Going on all the outings is another important way of 
              getting things signed off. Read your book before hand, so you know 
              what to concentrate on. Most importantly, we have lots of fun on 
              our outings that you don't want to miss.</p>

              Brian </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>For my Eagle service project, I built 
              a map kiosk. But what is a &quot;map kiosk&quot; anyway? A map kiosk 
              is essentially a special bulletin board. It consists of a basic 
              frame made up of two 6x6's and two 4x6's with plywood in the middle. 
              The map kiosk will have on it a couple of &quot;attachments&quot;, 
              which will make it more than a simple bulletin board. The attachments 
              include, a map of the park that will be protected by, but still 
              visible through Plexiglas. It will have two bulletin boards, one 
              for the rangers to use, which will be covered by a Plexiglas door 
              and another for the public to use. It will also have another permanently 
              covered Plexiglas display, which will house some general information. 
              The map kiosk will also have a map dispenser so that the public 
              will be able to get maps of Santa Teresa County Park. The entire 
              display area has a small roof over it and its legs are buried in 
              the ground. Now you're probably wondering how I built it, right? 
              Well the answer for the attachments is simple; the park is adding 
              all them. The rest however, we, the troop, did. But enough describing 
              what it is, time to learn why it was needed. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The map kiosk was necessary to provide 
              information on Santa Teresa County Park, such as the trails and 
              what the historic section (where we placed it) is all about. Previously, 
              there wasn't anything at the trailhead giving the trail a name, 
              distance, or even destination. This meant that unless you asked, 
              were psychic, or had a map, you wouldn't know where it goes.</p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The map kiosk didn't just fix this 
              problem, but it also provides additional information. The park has 
              a very tight budget and the maintenance is very busy. This means 
              that it would have taken a while before they could of gotten around 
              to building the map kiosk. One was needed though, for it benefits 
              everyone. The public is greatly benefited from this, for as I've 
              stated above, there was no information on the trail or any maps 
              to take. The rangers aren't always there so even if someone wanted 
              to ask about where it went, they wouldn't of been able to. Having 
              a map kiosk eliminates the need to ask the rangers, meaning that 
              when they are there they won't be bugged about where the trail goes 
              and what the historic section is all about; people will be able 
              to look on the map kiosk!!! Enough about the why it was so important, 
              it is time to learn how it was built. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>My project started when I contacted 
              Mr. Dorrance, an education Ranger at Santa Teresa County Park, and 
              he told me that he had a project that I could do. I visited the 
              park the next weekend and we drove to Almaden Quicksilver park to 
              see an example of the map kiosk I was to build. After I decided 
              to build it, I needed the materials. Mr. Dorrance told me that we 
              could go to an area in Hellyer Park where they recycle all of the 
              things that were once something. So my dad and I went with Mr. Dorrance 
              and found almost all of the wood we needed to build it. The place 
              was amazing, there were lots of old picnic tables, some big hunks 
              of concrete, food lockers, tons of wood, and even two assembled 
              bridges, which must span a hundred feet. The trip probably saved 
              hundreds of dollars on supply costs. After going to Hellyer, we 
              only needed three more pieces of wood and some hardware. To get 
              these my dad and I first went to Home Depot, which had nothing. 
              We then went to Pinecone, which had everything that we needed. Once 
              we had all of the materials (we got everything but the paint/stain 
              which we got the week we painted/stained it.), we were ready for 
              the first day. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>On April 27th, we met at 9:00 am to 
              build the map kiosk. We were a little slow at getting started and 
              it was hard the first day to keep everyone working. This was due 
              partially to lack of planning and the fact that there were two groups 
              doing drastically different things and often needing the same saws. 
              We divided up into two groups, the first consisting of Eric, James, 
              and</p>
          </td>
          <td valign="middle"> 
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Bryant, built the frame while the second, 
              made up of Karl, Alex, Jordan, and Daniel, built the roof. The second 
              group got the frame of the roof assembled and found about a third 
              of the shingles, which we would need the next week. The first group 
              got the two 6x6's cut (except for the top of them which wasn't finished 
              until we put it in) and also got the 4x6's cut. This was fairly 
              difficult since most of it needed ripping, which Eric did. Eric 
              kept binding up the blade and eventually killed the saw. He will 
              however, blame this on the fact that the saw blade was dull, which 
              was true of course. When we got a new blade, he was able to cut 
              much better. The turnout wasn't as good as I was hoping, but there 
              were the most amount of people of any of the other days, and although 
              we didn't get all of what I had hoped done (I'm not sure having 
              more people would have helped much because of organization), it 
              was enough to be able to finish the next weekend. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>On May 4th, we again met at 9:00 so 
              that we could catch up to the plan of painting it on that weekend. 
              The sign was soon finished, which basically consisted of James and 
              Derek cutting the frame for around the plywood, and testing to make 
              sure the plywood fit (somehow it did on the 4th, but then didn't 
              when we went to put it in on the 11th). The roof part however, took 
              a little longer since we first had to cut the plywood to length, 
              and then make the facia boards. The ends were fairly complicated 
              but luckily I had a skilled worker, Karl, who managed to get them 
              cut fairly well. After the facia boards were cut, Alex and Edward 
              took turns stapling on the tarpaper. We then began putting on the 
              shingles. Once the frame of the sign was finished, we painted/stained 
              it, thus concluding the second day of the project. </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The third day, May 5th, James and Daniel 
              arrived around 3:30. However my dad, my sister, and I, started working 
              on it earlier in an attempt to fix the shingles on the roof. There 
              were a couple of problems with the roof. The first was that by the 
              second and third row, the way we had been cutting the shingles made 
              them stick up in an ugly, weak, and useless fashion. Another problem 
              was that we had forgotten to put in a starting row. The third and 
              final problem was we had put on the tarpaper the way the plans specified. 
              The plans had the tar paper wrap under the facia boards </p>

              a puddle, something we didn't want. So we spent a long time taking 
              off the shingles (trying not to break them). We then put on another 
              piece of tar paper, and put on the shingles with a starter row, 
              and leaving them long so that the wouldn't stick up. Daniel helped

              we unloaded everything. Matthew, James, and Bryant then cleared

              assembling the sign. This was a little hard since we ended up having 
              to modify the rafters to accommodate the top 4x6. After solving 
              the problem with the 4x6 and rafters, we assembled the sign, put 
              on the facia boards, and added the ridge boards. The digging was 
              very slow in the rock hard ground, inspite of the fact that we had 
              a roto-hammer. We were digging until around 1:30 before we finally 
              had deep enough holes to put the sign into. After putting the sign 
              in, we had to mix eight bags of concrete, which was barely enough 
              (the plans called for four). Once we finished putting in the sign, 
              we took our &quot;finished&quot; picture, I wrote &quot;T 463&quot; 
              and &quot;BT&quot; in the concrete and, finally, we were finished 
              with my project. </p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>In my (totally unbiased) opinion the 
              sign turned out great! I invite everyone to go see it. It is at 
              Santa Teresa County Park. I would like to thank everybody who helped 
              me out, especially James Enomoto who put in the most hours to help 
              me. He was there every single day! I would also like to thank Mr. 
              Dorrance, my contact in the park, for his help planning, executing, 
              and getting materials for the project. Thanks to him we didn't need 
              to use all pressure treated wood! Finally I would like to thank 
              my father, for without his help getting the materials, providing 
              transportation, helping iron out the flaws in the plans, and help 
              executing the project it would have never finished, not to mention 
              finished on time. Thank you everyone who helped, it wouldn't have 
              happened without you!</p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The JLT (junior leader training) started 
              off with the leadership meeting at the church and heading over to 
              a local park to do some exercises and discuss leading methods. One 
              of the exercises was making a shelter out of a tarp and some poles. 
              After a couple hours of this we headed back to the church and made 
              two different prototype catapults in preparation for the next meeting. 
              Once the catapults were built we had a water balloon fight. Of course 
              the senior patrol won with an amazingly accurate catapult. Finally 
              after a long day of discussions, water balloon fights, and discussing 
              water balloon fights, we drove to Sanborn Park and had more discussions. 
              At last we got to go to sleep. In the morning we had a discussion 
              about next year's outtings. After cleaning up we got into the cars 
              and drive home.</p>

              Eric </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The bike outing was going to be great; 
              I was ready for it. I wake up with a start when I realized the bike 
              trip was today, I looked out the window at the beautiful...rain? 
              Well, to make a long story short the outing was delayed, then delayed 
              again. After the second rescheduling we finally got the outing off 
              without a hitch, and believe me when I say without a hitch I mean 
              without a hitch. It was a beautiful day as we biked down Ca&ntilde;ada 
              road, not a cloud in the sky. Well, maybe there was one cloud, but 
              only a wisp. We didn't have to worry about cars because Ca&ntilde;ada 
              road is closed every Sunday for bikers. There was a gentle breeze, 
              and except for a couple places the biking was easy. Ca&ntilde;ada 
              road turned into a busy street, unfortunately, but we quickly went 
              back onto a bike trail. The bike trail was nicely paved and shady. 
              From the bike trail we went up towards San Andreas reservoir. After 
              awhile we stopped and ate lunch under a tree. Once we finished lunch 
              we turned around and biked back. The total distance was approx. 
              28 miles round trip. This was an exceptionally great outing in my 
              slightly biased opinion.</p>

              Brian </p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The April outing was to Pinnacles. 
              We arrived at about nine and immediately (well after getting organized 
              and covered in suntan lotion), we set off on our five-mile hike. 
              It was a little slow moving, but it was fun! It was nice weather, 
              sunny but not too hot and very good visibility. We stopped a couple 
              of times to work on map and compass skills (the hardest skills to 
              master.) When we got to the top (about halfway), we stopped to have 
              lunch. After lunch, we had some more hiking, this time only downhill. 
              The younger scouts seemed to love going downhill, running half the 
              way, however, others of us didn't like it so much. We took another 
              stop at the lake and then prepared to go through the cave. We were 
              all excited about going through it and were thinking how lucky we 
              were since it was closed last year. We started into the cave and 
              less than a hundred yards later discovered . . . that the caves 
              were closed:(. We then had to walk above them, wishing we were in 
              them. We got to camp at around 3:00. After setting up camp, we had 
              some free time until dinner. We worked on some more requirements 
              during this time and had some fun chopping wood, while at the same 
              time earning the Totin' Chip card. We then had dinner, which was 
              lacking in some ingredients, then had more free time before going 
              to bed. The next morning, we woke up and had French toast, again 
              lacking some ingredients, packed up camp and went home </p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>That's right: it's the 2002 Camporee. 
              Well, where to start? First, it can pretty much be summed up like 
              this: Webelos. NOTHING rhymes with them. Because of our 12 Webelos 
              and their parents, we had something like the 4th biggest troop there. 
              Overall, the outing was endless fun. The first day, we organized 
              the massive Webelos contingent, arrived, and set up our tents _ 
              a rather daunting task due to the aforementioned masses of Webelos. 
              We had some difficulties with organization and cooperation along 
              the way, but they didn't really disrupt the outing much. We went 
              out and did our events, and did pretty well: all our patrols were 
              on the high end of the 2nd place group, and we would have done even 
              better if we could spare leadership for staff (hey, don't look at 
              me, I was busy regulating Webelos). Next year, hopefully, with some 
              new OA members, I think we can definitely break into the 1st place 
              group. Anyway, we had fun, which was what's important. Then we had 
              dinner, which was even more fun. Both patrols had well-planned, 
              nutritious meals. And then we went to the campfire, which included 
              the soft-spoken but nevertheless brilliant Webelos performing our 
              troop's classic skit, &quot;Robbers.&quot; Finally, we went to sleep. 
              And when we woke up, there was a beautiful light mist around the 
              campsite. A light mist that turned into a heavier mist. A heavy 
              mist that turned into a drizzle. A drizzle that turned into a relentless 
              soaking downpour. Yeah. That part wasn't fun. But we were prepared, 
              and we got home without anyone drowning, so everything was still 
              ok</p>
