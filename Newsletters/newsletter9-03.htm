        James</p>
      <p>I hope that everybody had a good summer. Nearly all of the members of 
        the Wolverine patrol went to Camp Oljato for summer camp. I hope you all 
        had a fun time, even if the weather didn&#146;t cooperate with us. Since 
        you probably won&#146;t get this much rain or hail next year, I would 
        like for you go to summer camp again. I know all of you enjoyed sleeping 
        out in the rain, but I think that you will enjoy camp even more when it 
        is sunny all week.<br>
        Congratulations to the Wolverine patrol for getting through the hardships 
        of summer camp and our first year together as a patrol. Last year was 
        a very successful year for us. I feel that you have all learned a lot, 
        and it showed with our 2nd place ribbon from the Camporee. This year you 
        will learn even more skills and hopefully gain rank rapidly. In order 
        to gain rank, talk to Alex or me at the meeting, or call me at home so 
        you can finish some of your requirements. So far, nobody from the Wolverines 
        has asked me to get anything signed off. Even though our numbers are decreasing, 
        I still believe we will have a good year, and hopefully you will have 
        more fun this year too.</p>

      <p align="center">Spoons Patrol Report!<br>
        Bryant</p>
      <p> Well, a lot has changed since the last Court of Honor. Our troop has 
        lost a few of its members, but the scouts who stayed have matured and 
        learned from their experiences in the troop. Although there are less people 
        now in the Spoons, there are positives to the change- those who remain 
        are dedicated in learning more skills and advancing in rank. By the next 
        Court of Honor, hopefully all of the Spoons will be at Tenderfoot (or 
        above!). <br>
        This is a new year, and there will be new opportunities- new skills, different 
        outings, new goals, and new scouts by the end of the year. Scouts will 
        have to learn how to become leaders, and I won&#146;t lie- it is not easy. 
        However, I have confidence that the Spoons will take full advantage of 
        these opportunities, and will continue to learn and grow.</p>

      <p>I have just finished writing about Canada so read that one; therefore, 
        I&#146;m not going to say a lot as SPL. I would however like to say a 
        few things. Firstly, I would like to congratulate everyone who is getting 
        rank and stress how important it is for you guys to be working hard on 
        these requirements. We are all very happy to have more tenderfoot scouts, 
        and will be even happier when you become First Class scouts and start 
        helping us lead the troop. If you joined between February to March and 
        are getting Tenderfoot or higher, you are making good progress. For those 
        of you who don&#146;t have tenderfoot or higher, I think that you guys 
        need to work harder. We have tried our best to get you through the requirements, 
        but Boy Scouts is about you not us, and, therefore, is individual. We 
        would all be more than happy to help you, but if you don&#146;t show initiative, 
        we won&#146;t. Whatever rank you are going for, going on the outings is 
        the best time to get things signed off and the best time to have fun. 
        Our attendance has been okay but I would be a lot happier if everyone 
        went on everything. Keep up the good work and remember, there&#146;s always 
        room for improvement.</p>

      <p>A few notes on troop equipment. I don&#146;t know if any of you have 
        noticed, but out of most of the troops around, we have the best equipment. 
        We have great backpacking tents, a few great car camping tents and some 
        good old A-frames. All of them work and we would like to keep them this 
        way. Recently I spent a few hours checking them and they all work. Things 
        are probably going to be changing slightly in the way things are checked 
        in to ensure they stay that way, please bear with us. Furthermore, you 
        can help a lot in keeping the tents good. If you sign out a tent and don&#146;t 
        sign it back in on the outing you need to go home and air it out that 
        day, not the next day or week. We give honor patrol points (or rather 
        take them off) for late tents, but this is just a reward for doing what 
        is right, not the reason it is necessary. If you don&#146;t air out the 
        tents they will decay, break, and smell bad, something none of you want. 
        Also a note about your packers, very soon, all of the stuff will be fixed 
        so that all packers are the same, if you mistreat, damage or lose any 
        piece of them, you will be responsible for replacing it and will be lacking 
        it until you do, so PLEASE TAKE CARE OF OUR EQUIPMENT. Again thank you 
        for your help and understanding.<br>

          August 30-September 1, 2003<br>
          David</p>
        <p align="left">The Manchester Beach outing was metaphorically covered 
          in awesome sauce. The drive there was long (4 hours) and nausea-inducing. 
          At first we didn&#146;t know whether we could get in; there weren&#146;t 
          any staff people at the campsite because of &#147;severe budget cuts&#148;, 
          but then we figured out how to open the gate; we parked right next to 
          our campsite. The site was essentially on a level field; it had some 
          picnic tables and a fire pit. It was next to a cool forest. By cool, 
          I mean literally rather cold (though not uncomfortably so). The trees 
          were kinda bent - like their branches curved sideways and down and interlocked 
          with one another, making a moss-covered, living cave there between the 
          rows of trees. When you walked inside the hollow you could feel a wall 
          of cold. Anyway, on the first day, we set up camp, ate lunch, did some 
          advancement, and, of course, went down to the beach. It was only a couple 
          minutes to walk to the beach. The beach was rather cold and foggy, but 
          it was still awesome. We played in the sand and watched the water; some 
          of us skimboarded, made sand castles (and by sand castle I mean INVINCIBLE 
          SAND FORTRESS), etc. When we got back, we made dinner, cleaned up, made 
          a fire, played cards, and went to sleep. We were thinking about looking 
          for Mars, but it was completely overcast so we couldn&#146;t really 
          see anything. The second day, we did all the normal stuff, and then 
          had an advancement session; the younger scouts learned fire skills, 
          as well as knife, axe and saw skills. Anyway, we went back down to the 
          beach again for most of the afternoon and played around some more </p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>(our sand fortress was unidentifiable, due 
        to the very good reason that it was probably COMPLETELY UNDERWATER - we 
        had built it during low tide, so the ocean couldn&#146;t do anything to 
        it then, but when we came back it was high tide, so we couldn&#146;t even 
        tell where it was in the first place). We hiked down maybe 1.5 miles (on 
        the way, we saw a bunch of people fishing, lots of driftwood, the air 
        bubbles of about a billion sand crabs, and about 3 dead seals), ate lunch, 
        and did map and compass work there, since there were two specific, distinctive 
        gullies right next to us that we could identify topographically. After 
        that, we just basically messed around - some of us buried others of us, 
        some of us played in a little pond, some of us skimboarded, and some of 
        us tried to skimboard for the first time and <br>
        mostly fell down and got completely soaked but it was all good, because 
        it was still a lot of fun. It was a lot less foggy the second day, but 
        still pretty cold. The hike back was pretty cool; it was really relaxing 
        just to watch the waves. When we got back, we ate dinner, cleaned up and 
        stuff, etc. Then, the sun started to set, and it was beautiful; if you 
        went into the cool little hollow, it was completely filled with the light 
        of the sunset... it was breathtaking. We quickly organized everyone and 
        rushed down to the cliff edge to watch the sun over the horizon. Anyway, 
        after that, we made a fire and repeatedly whacked it with a stick just 
        to take a picture of the sparks flying everywhere. Finally, at night, 
        the sky had cleared, so we looked at the stars and identified several 
        constellations. We thought we couldn&#146;t see Mars, but then we realized 
        it was just behind a big tree. Mars looked pretty cool, it was definately 
        really bright, and you could tell it had a reddish color. Overall, it 
        was a great outing, as our beach trips always are.</p>

        July 27-August 2, 2003<br>
        James</p>
      <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Each year, Troop 463 spends a week at summer camp. This 
        year we traveled high into the Sierras (elevation 7,000 feet) to Camp 
        Oljato, which is located on Huntington Lake. Our trip began on Sunday, 
        July 27, when 21 scouts and 4 adult drivers left the church a little after 
        7am. After about a 5-hour ride, including 2 stops for lunch and snacks, 
        we arrived at the camp parking lot. From here, everybody had to ride a 
        boat to the other side of the lake, where the camp is located. Although 
        we arrived a little before our scheduled departure time, we still had 
        to wait, before catching the last boat across.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After reaching camp, we 
        had to carry all our equipment to Navajo campsite, our home for the next 
        week. After a short orientation of the camp and swim test, we returned 
        to Navajo to setup our gear. This year was a little different, since we 
        shared a campsite with another troop from the Los Angeles area. They had 
        to travel over 8 hours to get here. It was a little confusing at first, 
        trying to get everybody organized, but we finally did it. We were starving 
        by now and were ready for our evening flag ceremony and dinner. Contrary 
        to the beliefs about camp food, the cooks at Oljato came up with some 
        very tasty meals (much better than our past 2 years at different camps&#133; 
        ask the older scouts). After our opening campfire, later that evening, 
        we headed back to camp for some much needed sleep.<br>

      <p align="left">fast, we all went to our various skills and merit badge 
        classes. The day started out great, and we appeared to be off to a great 
        start&#133;..but, later in the afternoon, dark clouds started forming, 
        along with the sound of distant thunder. Nothing to worry about, right! 
        Short, afternoon, thunder showers that quickly pass, are not supposed 
        to be that common. Well, I guess it was overdue. A light sprinkle developed 
        into a steady rain, which continued off and on for the rest of the week. 
        At first, many of the older scouts saw the rain as a good thing, which 
        seemed to solve the usual dust problem. But, rain was not the only surprise 
        Mother Nature had in store for us. We even experienced a brief hailstorm. 
        This shocked everybody. You have to remember this is summer, and we were 
        expecting sun. Actually, we got some sunny periods and mild evenings and 
        were still able to have fun and accomplish quite a bit, as shown by all 
        the merit badges we earned. This is also probably the reason for our higher, 
        than usual, number of partials. These uncompleted merit badge blue cards 
        will be returned at the Court of Honor, in hopes that all of you will 
        contact a counselor and get them completed, SOON. Our schedule for the 
        rest of the week was pretty similar. Every morning we would wake up at 
        7am, go to the flag ceremony, have breakfast, and go to classes or relax. 
        Lunch was served at 12:15pm, then another class session, until free time 
        at 3pm. During this time we could work on skills and badges or just have 
        fun fishing, sailing, rowing, canoeing, rifle shooting, climbing, or whatever 
        we wanted.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask any of the 
        younger scouts what part of camp they liked best, their answer might surprise 
        you. It wasn&#146;t the merit badges, the water activities, the foosball 
        table, the rifle range, or even the ping pong table someone made back 
        at camp. No, it was the trading post. Over the course of the week, many 
        of the scouts spent tons of money, usually buying candy and soda, with 
        an occasional souvenir. Whenever someone was missing, you could usually 
        find him there. Yet, the scouts were not the only ones having fun. During 
        his week at camp, Mr. Root was able to finish his mile swim, something 
        few people even try, and fewer people finish. Mrs. Corley (the rower), 
        me (the spotter), and Mr. Root woke up at 5am Friday to do this. It was 
        COLD! Mr. Root and Mrs. Corley also were able to go</p>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Camp Oljato staff tried 
        to make the rainy conditions a little easier on us. During our evening 
        activities, they would invite us to the mess hall to watch movies. They, 
        along with the adults and senior scouts, did a pretty good job keeping 
        the younger scouts dry by repositioning the tents, retying supports, etc. 
        One thing all you scouts should have learned&#133;BE PREPARED!!!!!!! Never 
        leave home without it! Your PONCHO or RAIN GEAR, of course! To all you 
        new scouts, I hope the weather did not discourage you from attending summer 
        camp next year. Rain is something you may encounter during your time in 
        the troop, but it is more often sunny. Remember, for me, this is the first 
        time it rained in 6 years at summer camp. I hope everybody had fun and 
        is looking forward to next summer. Finally, thanks to all the parents 
        who planned this trip for us, drove, and stayed at camp. </p>

        June 20 - June 28, 2003<br>
        Brian Thurgate</p>
      <p>Our trip to Canada started on the 20th with only Alex, Mr. Tan, Mr. Thurgate, 
        and me (Brian (for now!)) Upon arriving we had to go get fuel for the 
        stoves, which turned out to be slightly more difficult than it would seem. 
        We started by attempting to go to an outdoor store, but given how far 
        (and hard to get to) it was, we decided to stop by some stores on the 
        way in an attempt to get some; however, in Canada, nobody sells it except 
        outdoor stores, until you have been there for a few days (we later found 
        fuel at every store we went to). After shopping, we settled in for the 
        long drive to our backpacking site, stopping twice on the way, the first 
        for dinner, then at a waterfall viewpoint. Although the </p>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <p align="left">waterfall was very neat, and the first thing we went to 
        see in Canada, it was nothing compared to what we would see later.<br>
        We woke up early the 21st, our first full day in Canada in order to start 
        our backpacking trip. The weather was fairly nice, it wasn&#146;t bright 
        and sunny, so it was a fairly pleasant hike in, in terms of temperature; 
        although, the clouds did limit our view up the valley. It was, however, 
        better visibility than we would have for many days, but I&#146;m getting 
        ahead of myself. When we got around three-fourths of the way to camp, 
        it started snowing. This was fairly exciting, and we figured that it was, 
        like in the Sierras or Colorado Rockies, an afternoon storm that would 
        soon be gone, taking with it the overcast skies. Were we ever mistaken! 
        It soon cleared up as we had expected and, a bit later, we got into camp. 
        After setting up our tents, it started snowing again. It was very light, 
        a mere drizzle but it made doing things less fun. We tried to light a 
        fire for about 30 minutes before Mr. Tan finally succeeded, the fire didn&#146;t 
        last long though for we didn&#146;t tend it very well and the snow got 
        harder. We played cards and ate then went to bed.<br>
        The following morning, June 22nd, the second day of summer was very beautiful, 
        although totally un-summer like. There was a good two inches of snow on 
        the ground, and just as much on our tents and dining fly. It had gotten 
        so cold the night before that the rope holding up the fly was encased 
        in ice, very awesome. We all had a good laugh given everything was covered 
        with snow the second day of summer, but were happy that it had snowed 
        during the night, not during the day, or so we thought in the morning. 
        It was definitely overcast but we didn&#146;t worry a lot about it, finding 
        the snow on the second day of summer rather bemusing. Day two was supposed 
        to be the hardest due to its length and its elevation change. We had to 
        go over a pass to get to our next camp. Despite the disheartening name, 
        Tombstone, we were all in good spirits as we set off. We hadn&#146;t been 
        hiking long when it started snowing again, slowing the pace even more. 
        The snow didn&#146;t really stick though; it just slowly fluttered out 
        of the sky and melted when it hit the ground or us. The snow, although 
        unasked for, did make the steep climb fairly easy by keeping us cool, 
        I can&#146;t even begin to imagine climbing the pass in broad </p>

          the pass, and as we got farther and farther up, our progress slowed 
          more and more. We finally reached the cutoff trail, which led two ways, 
          the first was the road which led straight over the pass and the second 
          was a trail which led to Tombstone Lake. We took the latter which seemed 
          a lot longer than we thought it would be. It was gorgeous though, it 
          had cleared slightly and the view back towards our camp and Mount Remus 
          was cool. Also along the way, the snow being a good 4-6 inches here, 
          there were little yellow flowers poking up through the snow. When we 
          got to the top, it was an insanely steep decent down to the lake. Somehow 
          we took the wrong trail and circled the lake to the right instead of 
          to the left. The view from the side of Tombstone Lake opposite its namesake 
          mountain was stunning. The lake was fairly calm and the craggy rocks 
          of Tombstone Mountain reflected in the lake, giving the place a very 
          rugged and totally cool look. We then continued down from the pass, 
          a much faster trip than the way up, and were soon at camp. We ate lunch 
          and set up camp then sat around playing cards, reading, or just relaxing. 
          It had stopped snowing before we got to camp, and we thought that the 
          storm may have passed since it was clearing up, affording great views 
          up the valley that Mr. Thurgate and I hiked up the next day. We actually 
          got things to mostly dry before the snow returned.</p>

        <p align="left">The third day of summer was very similar to the third, 
          minus the snow-covered ground in the morning. Alex decided he didn&#146;t 
          want to go on the day hike so Mr. Tan stayed with him, while Mr. Thurgate 
          and I hiked to Elbow Lake. The hike there was pretty interesting; when 
          we got about halfway there it started snowing again. It was much heavier 
          snow this time, and it continued until we got to the lake. We were very 
          fortunate for </p>

    <td> 
      <p style='text-align:justify;'>as we got to the lake, the snow stopped and 
        the sky cleared enough for us to see Mt. Elpoca behind the lake. As we 
        left, the weather socked in again and it started snowing. This time it 
        was heavy enough to stick, and in short order, there was a thin layer 
        of snow on the ground. This made the flowers look very neat. However, 
        it also made the ground very wet and limited the visibility. As we approached 
        the cutoff where we needed to decide whether or not to hike to Lake Rae, 
        the snow was letting off so we decided to, and as we got to the top of 
        the first ridge, the snow stopped and the sun came out, quickly drying 
        us. It was a cross-country trail to the lake, and going by the limited 
        description in the book, our terrible map, and our best guess as to where 
        the lake was, we plunged off into the undergrowth. The going was slow 
        and steep but we were soon over the top of the ridge that we figured the 
        lake was in, and beheld, absolutely nothing, well; there were trees rocks 
        and undergrowth, but no lake. We concluded that it wasn&#146;t there and 
        continued on. It took way longer than we expected and we were beginning 
        to think there was no lake, when, lo and behold, more ridges to climb. 
        After climbing the final ridge, we beheld the lake, took some pictures 
        then, yup, you guessed it, it started snowing. We huddled under a tree, 
        and ate lunch while beholding the serenity of nature and the snowflakes 
        slowly fluttering to the ground. After this we decided to head back to 
        camp via Sheep Lakes. We saw a trail across the river so decided to jump 
        it. It was only about five feet wide but jumping it was still a little 
        scary due to the swift current and how cold it was. We continued on this 
        trail for quite a while before we got tired of going the wrong way, apparently 
        we had found a trail that wasn&#146;t on the map. We then cut straight 
        down the hill, doing true cross-country. This turned out to be a disaster, 
        in my opinion. Well, it wasn&#146;t that bad, but it was long and by the 
        end, my shoes were so wet that every time I took a step water oozed out 
        (then back in while still in the swamp). You see, we were in a swamp. 
        A very long one, the water was just low enough to provide a few dry places 
        to step, but in an attempt at staying dry (don&#146;t ask me why I cared, 
        my shoes were soaked through) but I did and it made me fairly slow. When 
        we finally got to the bottom, we looked back up and saw the trail, right 
        were it should have been, on the other side of the </p>

      <p align="left">river (it turns out not only did we not have to cross the 
        river, it led us out of the way.) We then continued to Sheep Lakes and 
        then back towards camp. Right before camp we had to cross a much bigger 
        river and I was forced, (still worried about my sponges, err, shoes, getting 
        wet) to take off my shoes and use a 2 foot stick for balance and crossed 
        it. At camp when we had a fire, in the evening, I dried my socks, and 
        tried to dry my shoes. This was quite fun for I&#146;d heat up a rock 
        and drop it in my shoe, then watch the steam pour out while attempting 
        not to let it burn anything. I did this for a while and when I was satisfied 
        that they were at least half leather, I gave up. That night shortly before 
        going to bed we saw a really cool glow over a nearby mountain; it was 
        very dim yet very cool.<br>
        The following morning we hiked to our third camp. In the morning while 
        getting ready to leave, we saw a couple of icefalls (mini avalanches on 
        a nearby mountain which funneled into waterfalls of snow and ice). The 
        hike was beautiful and finally it was relatively clear. As we walked the 
        view up and down our valley was very neat, and the peaks with snow on 
        them added to the splendor. There were some pretty steep sections, both 
        up and down on our trail, but that&#146;s what we get when we let Alex 
        lead. As we neared camp, we saw a cave up to our left, which had a small 
        waterfall falling in the middle of its mouth. We got to camp around lunchtime, 
        and as we finished lunch another group arrived. Although this wasn&#146;t 
        the first group we had seen, it was the most memorable. The leader came 
        over and notified us that it was a juvenile delinquent group of teenagers. 
        He then went and hid the axe (in Canada, every backpacking camp has one, 
        very fun!!!) and warned us to watch our stuff. Although nothing happened 
        (that we know of), it was a little spooky with them right there.<br>
        The next and final day of our backpacking in Canada was, in many ways, 
        the best. It was very clear and a very easy hike. We stopped on the way 
        twice, the first time was to see a waterfall and the second a viewpoint. 
        The waterfall was very neat; it was about half a mile up a side canyon 
        and was very neat because you could walk behind it. After this we continued 
        until we reached a &#147;grassy knoll.&#148; This was pretty cool because 
        it was only 300 feet from the trail to the top. Well three hundred vertical 
        feet (and about that many horizontal, </p>
      </td>
    <td>very steep). The view from the top was amazing. The peaks around us were 
      the best panorama we had yet seen in Canada. We then continued to the cars 
      and drove off to eat lunch. We had lunch by a small little lake of a beautiful 
      emerald green hue. While eating, a squirrel visited us, and, like so many 
      later squirrels would do, it stood up on its hind legs begging for food. 
      We of course didn&#146;t feed it, not wanting to hurt the environment more, 
      and were soon on our way.<br>
      We woke up late the next day on nice comfortable beds. The hotel was a nice 
      bonus after the backpack trip. We went for a fairly long drive, enjoying 
      the lack of fifty plus pounds on our back. We saw a couple of elk (not Meece, 
      Eric is still the only one who&#146;s seen one with antlers) grazing on 
      the side of the road. Our highlight of the day however, was our day hike 
      up Johnston canyon which ended at the inkpots. It was a pretty cool hike; 
      the first part was on a boardwalk type thing directly over the river, very 
      spooky. The lower fall was pretty neat, fairly high with a lot of water. 
      The viewpoint for it was pretty awesome too; you walk through this short 
      cave and emerge with this huge thundering and breathtaking waterfall ten 
      feet in front of you. The upper fall was much taller than the bottom one 
      and there were two viewpoints. The first below it afforded views of the 
      incredible canyon wall in its entire multicolored splendor and its small 
      patch of snow in the middle. We then went to the top, on this deck like 
      thing which hung out over the valley. We then continued up to the paint 
      pots. They were pools of water which were deep blue with huge rings of black 
      in the middle and constantly had water bubbling up from their depths. The 
      view of the mountains and them was amazing and we wished we had brought 
      a snack to enjoy in the presence of such grandeur. We then hiked back and 
      had lunch, before we hiked up to Castle Mountain lookout. Although Alex 
      and therefore his dad didn&#146;t make it up near halfway, Mr. Thurgate 
      and I continued to the top where we had a 180 degree view of the valley 
      and surrounding mountains as well as a 180 degree view of sheer cliffs which 
      formed the crown of Castle Mountain. It was a beautiful hike and we spent 
      a good half hour on top. We then hiked down and returned to the beautiful 
      lakeside real estate we had got earlier that day.<br>
      The following morning, we drove to Banff. On

    <td width="50%">he way, we passed a small herd of bighorn sheep on the side 
      of the road. The babies were insanely cute. We then continued to the Banff 
      hotel, a monstrous building which resembled a castle. The pure scale of 
      the thing was amazing and it was very majestic, I could almost imagine it 
      back in the 18 hundred&#146;s when it was built (backwards.) We then went 
      down to Bow Falls. It was very weird because it was simply a cascade which 
      descended ten feet. Despite the lack of drop it was still pretty spectacular 
      due to the sheer volume of water which flows over it. We then went to the 
      place which started Banff National Park. It was a hot spring, which was 
      found by a couple of railroad workers and was the main tourist attraction 
      in the park for many years. The water was very warm, creating a habitat 
      for many unique animals. After the springs we went to a natural history 
      museum then back to camp, where we met up with the rest of the people who 
      went to Canada to begin our second week (their first) Thus ending the best 
      week of the Canadian trip.<br>

      <p>Fort Point <br>
        Saturday 6/28/2003<br>
        &nbsp;It was a clear and pleasant day in Canada on this fine Saturday 
        morning. Ready for adventure and full of eager anticipation, the three 
        new comers Mr. Webb, Daniel, and myself (Derek) began on our first hike 
        along with the previous adventuring crew of Brian, Mr. Thurgate, Alexander, 
        and Mr. Tan. This fist hike was up to Fort Point, where we new comers 
        encountered our first spectacular view of how Canada&#146;s scenery would 
        amaze us throughout our trip. During our 2.4-mile hike we had come across 
        several bikers who seemed to have trouble biking up some of the rather 
        steeper slopes. I would say over all that the bikers only did get to bike 
        a little over three fifths of the trail. For most of those slopes they 
        encountered, they had to drag their bikes up by hand. (Now if a 21-speed 
        mountain bike couldn&#146;t do some of that trail, that says a lot because 
        this was one of the easer hikes that we had done throughout the second 
        half of the trip. Many of the trails of any substance were fairly steep). 
        When we had reached one of the viewpoints, we were able to look out onto 
        the richest expanse of forest landscape that one would normally only see 
        in a national geographic magazine. It was a stunning vision of a deep 
        green forest melted over the rolling slopes of the foothills of a magnificent 
        snow capped giant. The forest seemed to cascade down from its alpine climate 
        zone into the mouth of the prosperous valley below. We took pictures, 
        drank water, and then </p>

        We explored our next viewpoint taking a few more pictures and eating a 
        light snack. When we decided to leave, we followed a trial that turned 
        out to be some sort of shortcut through the forest. The trial lead into 
        a heavily forested part of the mountainside, and began a very steep and 
        treacherous decent. Many times we would use tree limbs as support so as 
        not to fall down the mountain. For a while, we thought we might have a 
        bit of forest exploration to do, but we soon found the real pathway and 
        followed it to our cars. From there we continued on our trip up to Jasper.</p>
      <p>Practicing Our Rappelling<br>
        Sunday 6/29/03<br>
        &nbsp;On Sunday we awoke where we had set up our camp at an area within 
        fairly close proximity to our canyon guides. The camp ground had turned 
        out to be a horse pasture and during our stay was frequently roamed by 
        these friendly animals. It was a beautiful area full of life and within 
        a short walking distance to a nearby stream. This situation set the stage 
        for the most abundant amount of insects we had set eyes on the entire 
        trip. Our attempt to set up our bug canopy to keep the insects away from 
        the food did not go well. <br>
        It was also at this campsite that we met the two local dogs. On the occasions 
        in which they would grace us with their presence the scouts would play 
        fetch with them and tug of war. On one such occasion, we found that the 
        dogs would even play with sticks larger than themselves. The dogs turned 
        out to be one of the most amusing highlights in our stay. During several 
        of our fetch intervals with the dogs, one of them would try to run away 
        into the forest with the newly acquired toy. However, as you can imagine 
        the dogs never made it far with a stick in its mouth stretching out to 
        either side further than the dogs own body length. Our stay on the ranch 
        was very entertaining and we all enjoyed it very much. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        It was this fine Sunday on which we were scheduled to practice our rappelling 
        capabilities as rock climbers, and prepare us for our canyon adventures. 
        When our guides arrived, we all packed our gear into one 15-passenger 
        van, and then proceeded to cram ourselves in. It wasn&#146;t the most 
        comfortable experience; </p>
    </td>
    <td width="49%" valign="top"> 
      <p align="center">in fact it was so rugged that the people in the back seats 
        were told to wear their helmets. <br>
        When the road ended and the van could go no further, we put on our backpacks 
        and started our hike to the top of a nearby ridge. It was the very ridge 
        that the canyon had cut right through. When we reached the top, we took 
        a short break and then proceeded with our testing. The wind was extremely 
        active during most of our time spent on the ridge. It was so strong in 
        fact that at times we had to shout to each other in order to be heard. 
        <br>
        We were to memorize (if we did not already know) the commands used for 
        proper rappelling safety, and use them at all times. There were three 
        ropes on which each of us used to practice our harnessing technique and 
        rappelling. This was all done on the top of the ridge. Once the instructor 
        was satisfied, the ropes were hoisted over the side of the ridge. The 
        next part of our test was to see how well we handled tense situations. 
        We would each rappel about half way down the rock face of the ridge (only 
        about 15-20 feet down), then practice maneuvering in one of the instructed 
        situations, which we were told might happen to us while under one of the 
        waterfalls. <br>
        Fist we practiced rolling, which is pretty self-explanatory. We practiced 
        hanging, which meant we were to put our feet above us and hang upside 
        down then recover from it and rappel the rest of the way down. We tried 
        kneeling, and sitting against the rock face as well. For our final assent, 
        we were to untie a knot in the rope below us, which required us to maintain 
        a good grip on the rope so we wouldn&#146;t fall, and for some of us it 
        took both hands to undo. <br>
        When our practice was finished, we continued on to the next portion of 
        our canyoning practice. When we came across a stream, we set down our 
        backpacks and changed into our wetsuits. This stream was in fact one of 
        the waterfalls that we would rappel under the following day. Our changing 
        area was only 40 feet from a 400-foot cliff dropping into the canyon to 
        which the river fed. <br>
        When we were all suited up, we headed out to a more suitable drop point 
        into the canyon. As soon as we were on our way up the canyon, we were 
        told the fairly simple procedure by which we would travel: We were to

        we were to help the person behind us. We made our way up the canyon lending 
        a helping hand every once in a while to those whom were less agile. Eventually, 
        we came across a heavily shielded area known as Ogre Canyon. As soon as 
        we turned the corner into the dark alley of solid stone, the wind increased 
        its intensity as if to drive us out. The already cool pools of the canyon 
        were replaced by ice-cold water able to sting us even through our insulating 
        wet suits. After a while, we headed back using the same procedure as before. 
        The canyon was no large challenge, but it was dangerous if you were not 
        careful of your footing. There were many rocks slick with slimy brown 
        algae that had caused quite a few slips along the way. Luckily we were 
        all wearing wet suits that acted as a sort of cushion, and helmets. Several 
        of the deeper pools were subject to dives as we made our way back down 
        to our access point. <br>
        Have you ever heard of someone showering under a Canadian waterfall with 
        only swim trunks to insulate them from the cold? No? Then I have a blood-chilling 
        story to tell. It was close to late afternoon by the time we had begun 
        our hike back down from ridge. Only this time, we took a slightly different 
        rout. Why? It was so the guides could introduce us to the last waterfall 
        we would be rappelling down the next day. The scouts were dared to go 
        under it with only swim trunks on, so we did&#133; You may think that 
        we were foolish, but the truth is that we were just too lazy to change 
        into our wet suits again. The waterfall was a dazzling sight to behold; 
        it was virtually glowing with its white foaming curtains of water flowing 
        down the deep black rock face from which it leaped off of from far above. 
        However, the waterfall was quite dazzling in a very different way when 
        you feel it with your bare flesh. It felt like it was showering needles 
        by the bucketful. But the stinging sensation subsided after the first 
        encounter, for once that moment had passed you couldn&#146;t feel your 
        own skin. One by one we each dived under the waterfall to test our tolerance 
        and have a taste of what we would be going up against. Many would try 
        to stay under as long as they could, but if you were one of those who 
        wore no wet suit you would become numb quickly and then able to last as 
        long as you want or until your body could no longer heat </p>

        to a progressively short amount of time. After we were all chilled to 
        the bone (except those who had worn wet suits), we headed back to the 
        van and back onto the road/muddy trail that eventually lead back to our 
        camp site, where we made dinner, repacked for the next day, and went to

      <p>Canyoning - The Real Thing<br>
        Monday 6/30/03<br>
        We awoke on Monday eager to experience the canyoning for real. The morning 
        pretty much worked the same way as the morning before, only this time 
        we discovered that there would be only 2 guides during the actual adventure. 
        This way we would be able to get though the canyon with fewer delays. 
        In the car ride, we discussed how the group would be split up. At the 
        end, it was decided that the scouts would be allowed to go all together 
        first, and the adults would be in the second group. Little did we know 
        that this course of action would lead us scouts into a 4-hour canyoning 
        expedition. <br>
        The adults were to await our arrival at the bottom of the canyon, while 
        the scouts took the trail up the windswept ridge on that supposedly sunny 
        and warm summer day. As we breathed in the pollution free Canadian air, 
        we changed into the wet suits for which we were extremely grateful. <br>
        Once in the canyon, we began to sense the adventure. The rappel rope was 
        slung though 2 carabineers attached to 2 chains that were solidly bolted 
        three feet into solid rock. The rope was doubled over and both ends were 
        flung over the edge and the first guide would follow it down. Each time 
        the group finished one rappel, the rope was retrieved by pulling at one 
        end and letting the other end snake back through the carabineers, then 
        used for the next rappel. These 12-millimeter ropes were not the lightest 
        thing in the world and were even heavier when soaked; even so, a spare 
        was kept on every expedition, and for a very good reason too (sometimes 
        the guides had told us, the ropes did get stuck). <br>
        Our first rappel began with a 15-foot squeeze down a rock crevice and 
        then a drop into open air, where we dangled and slowly eased the rope 
        through </p>

        <p align="left">our harness. As each scout hit the pool below we wondered 
          what the next cliff would be like. It was a steep slant that then dropped 
          to a vertical and slippery rock face. We used a technique in which we 
          just let our rubber-guarded knees slide down the rock while we sat back 
          in our harnesses. The third rappel was similar, but the fourth had two 
          cliffs to it and a short distance in-between. <br>
          It was at about the middle of our canyoning experience that our sunny 
          day became&#133; not so sunny. In fact to our surprise, the dark clouds 
          that we had seen in the distance turned out to be thunderheads. And 
          that&#146;s when things started to get interesting. Up until now, we 
          would amuse ourselves by annoying one another from time to time. However 
          as the rain set in we decided to speed up the pace and get out of the 
          canyon. When waiting for the other scouts, those who had finished the 
          rappel would huddle under a rock overhang or ledge. The canyon began 
          to grow colder especially as we neared the rappel through our first 
          waterfall. <br>
          The thundering in the canyon was like nothing I had ever heard before. 
          It echoed off the walls and reverberated through every stone. As we 
          neared the base of the canyon the wind began to pick up and blew the 
          mist from the waterfalls right on to us. The guide instructed us to 
          get through the first waterfall as quickly as possible, or else we would 
          quite possibly become a human ice cube. This first waterfall was to 
          be the hardest decent of all. It dropped almost 80 feet in two cliffs, 
          one of which passed directly under the full impact of the largest waterfall. 
          This fall dropped at least 50 feet through mid air before pounding on 
          our heads. As I passed under it, it did not feel as strenuous as was 
          suggested. The water just bounced off my helmet and slid down around 
          me. For a moment all I saw was whiteness and all I felt was pressure 
          but no stinging cold, for my jacket provided an abundance of insulation. 
          As soon as I pulled free I scramble as fast as I could into the large 
          pool of water waiting below. <br>
          The temperature began to drop and a couple of the scouts were getting 
          really cold even through the protection of the wetsuit, hood, gloves, 
          and jacket. This is when we really had to pick up the pace. Then a most 
          undesirable thing happened, at our next waterfall rappel, the rope was 
          caught on something. We tried to free it for</p>
        </div>
    </td>
    <td valign="middle"> 
      <p style='text-align:justify;'>what seemed an hour but had no such luck. 
        We instead headed down the last two cliffs on our spare rope. <br>
        The next rappels went by much more smoothly, especially since we then 
        began to descend into a much more sheltered area. When we reached the 
        bottom, we retrieved the rope and headed back to the adults waiting a 
        little way down the stream. There we found a fire going and a brighter 
        and warming atmosphere waiting, for the sun had begun to come out from 
        behind its blanket of black foreboding thunderheads. We ate lunch and 
        stripped out of our cold wet suits to lay them out on sunny rocks to dry. 
        At that time with only one rope left, the guides decided that the party 
        of adults would attempt the canyoning later that week. <br>
        All in all, the canyoning was a most exciting experience, and if I have 
        the chance to do it again, I wouldn&#146;t hesitate to go. For that&#146;s 
        what High Adventure is all about: trying new things in an as safe and 
        exhilarating approach as possible. </p>

        &amp;<br>
        Celebrating Canada&#146;s National Holiday<br>
        Tuesday 7/01/03<br>
        Tuesday was planed to be a very full day. After packing up camp, we set 
        out to our first destination, Maligne Canyon. We ate a delicious lunch 
        of sandwiches and chips by the river and relaxed in the shade of the small 
        grove of trees. <br>
        We then set off on our hike in Maligne Canyon. It is a beautiful place 
        with fractured and jagged rock walls, and emerald green water flowing 
        smoothly through its rugged gorge. The abundant plant life sprouts up 
        along its crude rock walls, and trees lean across its gaping chasms. The 
        sound of the roaring water flow gives a sense of eternal tranquility. 
        We explored its boundaries, following the paths and bridges, taking pictures 
        and enjoying the scenery.&nbsp;<br>
        When we left Maligne Canyon, we headed to our second destination, Mt. 
        Whistler. Mt. Whistler is named because of its unusually high quantity 
        of Hoary Marmots, which make whistling sounds to communicate. When we 
        got there, we had to wait in line for a while before purchasing our tickets 
        for the tram we would be taking to a platform near the top of the mountain.

        <p align="left">we waited, we played cards. The tram was an astonishingly 
          swift transport. On the way up, we were given a lecture on the local 
          area, including the many lakes that occupied the valley, the two rivers 
          that surged beneath us as we were pulled higher and higher, and lastly 
          a detailed description on the famous mountain range and their historical 
          relevance to the first human explorers. Above all was the description 
          on Mt. Whistler, its inhabitance or Picas, Hoary Marmots, and other 
          such rodents. We were told about how almost all the trees were in fact 
          near the same age even though the top most trees nearest the peak were 
          only about three to five feet tall. The reason being that the altitude 
          and amount of sunlight the trees received gave very short growing seasons 
          and thus these three-foot tall trees were near five hundred years of 
          age. The famous mountain range had also become a memorial sight, for 
          the peaks of many were named after the bravest Canadian soldiers who 
          died in battle during the World Wars.<br>
          When we reached the upper platform, we set off to reach to the top of 
          Mt. Whistler. It was a fairly steep climb with some snow still remaining 
          partially shielded from the summer sun. When we reached the top, we 
          took pictures and Brian used a panoramic feature to take a circle of 
          pictures until he had a picture of the entire horizon. We found a sort 
          of sundial like object, which was able to point out the mountains while 
          you line the object up with the name of each mountain. We explored the 
          top of the mountain and some of the scouts used a cement block to play 
          cards on. However, we had to devise a way to hold them seeing as the 
          top of the mountain was exceptionally windy. On our way back down, we 
          tried to slide down the snow patch but with only slight effectiveness.	
          Our next destination was to watch the fireworks that were set off to 
          celebrate July First as it is Canada&#146;s National Holiday. This spectacular 
          event was conducted over an open green field with only one hundred yards 
          separating the onlookers from where they launched the fireworks. The 
          audience was practically underneath the fireworks. We all sat on a grassy 
          hill slick with water from slow drizzle that was soaking everything. 
          We listened to the sound of the explosions thundering off the mountainsides 
          and echoing down the valleys. It was one of the most spectacular firework 
          displays I have ever scene. <br>

        Early Wed morning we woke up early and drove to Brule to meet Jerry to 
        take the adults to rappel down Ogre canyon waterfalls. Together we hiked 
        to the ridge on top of Ogre Canyon where the adults changed into wetsuits 
        to prepare to go down the canyon. Derek, Daniel, Brian, and I then followed 
        a creek up to its source. Normally the source would spout water 20 ft 
        into the air, but this was not the right season. We went anyway and only 
        took 20 min to get there. The source was a large cavern that fit Brian, 
        Daniel, and I. On the way down, there was an excellent view of the valley. 
        We got back to the ridge and hiked to the bottom of the Ogre Canyon to 
        wait for the adults to appear. We waited a while and when we heard the 
        adults, we lit a fire so they would have something warm. <br>
        After lunch, we bid farewell to Jerry and thanked him for a very enjoyable 
        experience and headed west towards Jasper. We decided to spend the rest 
        of the day sightseeing the various lakes and waterfalls in the area like 
        Cavell Lake which was a lake with chunks of glacier floating around. The 
        other one was Athabasca Falls which was a magnificent sight with its multiple 
        levels of waterfall. The night was spent in Whistler&#146;s campsite.

        We started off early to leave for the Columbia Icefields. We drove straight 
        to the Visitor&#146;s Center and got there by 9:30am. So we spent half 
        an hour looking around the Center. At 10:00am we met up with the guide 
        and started on our hike of the Athabasca Glacier. </p>

        small compared to the other glaciers surrounding it. It took us 2 hours 
        to get midway up the glacier where we stopped for lunch. After lunch we 
        carried on for another half hour before we stopped because it was the 
        highest point where it was safe for regular hikers. On the way down, we 
        stopped and looked at several millwells which are holes in the ice caused 
        by meltwater gradually wearing away at the ice to form tunnels to the 
        base of the glacier. We also saw several crevasses some going down to 
        100 feet. <br>
        After leaving the glacier, we traveled to the Youth Hostel in Lake Louise 
        to spend the night. Once there, we showered and went to dinner. We spent 
        the evening relaxing at the exquisite lounge at the hostel before retiring 
        to our dorms. </p>

        We breakfasted at the communal kitchen before setting off to the Kicking 
        Horse river for whitewater rafting. When we got there, we were given wetsuits, 
        bootees, sweatshirts, helmets, and lifejackets. When we had suited up, 
        we boarded the bus that took us to the launch site to begin our expedition 
        down the river. The first half of our trip was class 1 and 2 rapids &#150; 
        that was the boring part. The second half was more exciting being class 
        3 and 4. Along the bank we saw several deer and some squirrels. The river 
        flowed through a few canyons and descended several hundred feet. <br>
        When we arrived back at the base, we were served a lunch of burgers and 
        grilled chicken sandwiches. Immediately after lunch, we left for Banff 
        and spent the night at Two-Jack campsite. </p>

      <p>This article is about the third and last week of our trip. As you already 
        know the first week was the Thurgates and the Tans backpacking around 
        in the Rockies. The second week the whole gang was there including the 
        Webbs and me, Daniel Lofgren. That was our week of extreme adventures. 
        Sadly for the third week Alex and Mr. Tan left and it was only me, Derek 
        and Mr. Webb, and Brian, and Mr. Thurgate. The theme for this week was 
        day hikes. Our group toured all over Yoho, Kootenay, Glacier, Mt. Revelstoke, 
        Jasper, and Banff National Parks. We saw many spectacular views and lovely 
        vistas. I will now go over some of the places we visited.</p>
      <p>The plain of six glaciers<br>
        This long but interesting hike was in my opinion the best of the dayhikes. 
        We started at the bottom at Lake Louis and hiked up a short way to a small 
        pond next to a rock formation known as Big Beehive. Once we saw it, the 
        reason for its name became evident. It was a large mound shape reminiscent 
        of a termite mound. It was covered on all sides with hundreds of small 
        depressions that looked like the honeycomb shape of beehives. These bees 
        would have had to be several yards long of course. The entire monolith 
        stood several hundred feet in the air and was quite sheer. </p>

        a small lake that was the deepest blue any of us had ever seen and none 
        of us would ever see a body of water that blue for nearly an hour (more 
        on that later). The next stop took us to the first of two teahouses that 
        we would see on our hike. We stopped and shared a large pot of tea. It 
        was very good which we probably should have expected because it was a 
        teahouse after all. All of the chipmunks in the area had been so tamed 
        by the constant presence of the humans that they could be convinced to 
        climb right up onto you for the prize of a nut. <br>
        The next leg of the trip took us to the top of the Big Beehive rock formation. 
        On top there was a small pagoda type wooden covering and a spectacular 
        view. Lake Louis below us was so vividly blue-green that it put the rest 
        of the lakes to shame. It looked like a god-proportioned child had dragged 
        a finger covered with sky blue finger-paints through the bottom of the 
        valley. We ate our lunch on the top of this hill and relaxed and took 
        pictures for about half an hour. We then set off once again.<br>

        over an hour. This part is also were the hike got its name from. At the 
        end of the hike, we began to see snow in ever increasing amounts. At this 
        point, people began to comment quite a lot about the state of Mr. Thurgate&#146;s 
        shoes. That is to say, they commented on the lack of shoes to comment 
        on. Its been said many times before, but I feel that I have to say it 
        again once more. NO SHOES IN SNOW!! How does he do it? No one knows. Anyway, 
        after we hiked over the last of the ridges, we saw it laid out before 
        us. It was a big flat-bottomed groove cut into the mountains. At the end 
        it split and branched like the delta of a mighty river in reverse. At 
        the end of each split there was a glacier. Yup, you guessed it, Six of 
        em. We looked at them for a while and then took some pictures. After that 
        it was time to start heading back.<br>
        On the way back, we stopped at the second teahouse and had snacks. After 
        that it was a smooth downhill hike back to the bottom of the lake were 
        the parking lot was. A day well spent in Canada. 5 out of 5 &#147;Dan

        An interesting note for any that are interested is that the campsite that 
        we stayed at while otherwise clean</p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>and welcoming had electric fences going around 
        the entire perimeter. While it is true that bears are considered a danger 
        in that area I think that the fence was a bit extreme. </p>
      <p>The Boardwalks<br>
        The first was a half-day hike through a swamp of reeds, berries and predominantly 
        Skunk Cabbage. The hike was quite enjoyable and the weather was quite 
        agreeable through the entire thing. The boardwalk was well built and sturdy. 
        The swamp was filled with wildlife from mayflies to frogs and fish. Near 
        the end we even saw a black bear with its cub, which at short range was 
        very cool. It was probably only 20 feet away from us but surprisingly 
        didn&#146;t seem to be very scared of us and simply left after a while. 
        The boardwalk had interesting and instructive signs at regular intervals. 
        Unfortunately in this case the emphasis was on had. A resident grizzly 
        named &#147;Macy&#148; had smashed most of them to pieces some years earlier 
        and they had not been replaced yet. This Hike was &#147;short but sweet&#148; 
        as the saying goes. 4 out of five &#147;Dan stars&#148;</p>
      <p> The second of the boardwalk hikes was through the forest. This one was 
        much shorter and lasted only 45 minutes. It was full of enormous trees 
        and a pleasant mossy smell. There were many fully intact instructive signs 
        that were pretty interesting. This hike didn&#146;t have a bear so in 
        my opinion needed a little extra wildlife. A bit to short and no bear.

      <p>Radium hot springs<br>
        This is the only event in the third week that was not a hike. To put it 
        simply, an absolutely massive hot tub! The Radium Hot Springs is a giant 
        heated pool. We spent several hours splashing around in this luxury, letting 
        out aches and pains of the last few days just soak away and leave us in 
        a contented stupor. A morning very well spent in Canada indeed. </p>

        Wapta Falls<br>
        This hike was a short two-hour jaunt. We hiked to the top of a ridge that 
        looked down on a waterfall that </p>

    <td width="50%">was quite wide but not very tall. It plunged straight down 
      and then got slammed against a large sandbar that caused a large amount 
      of spray up into the air. We hiked down to the river&#146;s side to get 
      a closer look. Once there we began to throw and skip stones. We amused ourselves 
      in this fashion for about 15 minutes and then went back up. An interesting 
      spectacle and some good clean fun.

        Avalanche Canyon<br>
        This hike was one of our favorites. It was a most of the day hike that 
        took 5 hours including the stop for lunch. We hiked up the middle of the 
        canyon for several hours until we came to the end. We then zigged and 
        zagged our way through snow up to the top of the ridge. The view was spectacular 
        and we could clearly see our campsite from where we were. We ate lunch 
        and stayed up there for about 45 minutes. Then we headed down. On the 
        way down Derek hallucinated about seeing an ermine and we teased him about 
        that for a bit. Definitely a good crisp hike.</p>

        Paint Pots<br>
        This was one of the most interesting hikes. We walked through an area 
        of semi-defoliated land that was coated in yellow dust and mud. We learned 
        that Indians who often traveled for many miles had used this clay. In 
        more recent times, the clay was mined and used for yellow paints. The 
        scenery of the area was very interesting and I found it oddly disquieting 
        how most of the plants looked like they were yellow and dead but still 
        growing. However the hike was really only a short jaunt and hardly filled 
        up an hour. </p>

        Marble canyon: <br>
        This sight was on the same day as the Indian clay hike. We walked a short 
        distance to a canyon that was filled with giant blocks of water-polished 
        marble and a small stream. While it was pretty to look at it wasn&#146;t 
        anything special</p>

        Mt. Revelstoke<br>
        We began this hike in the midmorning chill at the top of the mountain. 
        We hiked a small loop of the area and saw a few small furry woodland creatures. 
        After a while, we made our way to the top of the mountain that we were 
        on. Occupying the very top was a small abandoned fire tower that made 
        for a few good pictures. Brian took one of his panoramic pictures and 
        we made our way down again. It was an invigorating start for the day. 
        After we got down we went into one of the small lunch tables and had lunch 
        to a spectacular view. Definitely a good start to the day.</p>
      <p>Iceline Trail<br>
        This was one of our all day hikes. We started at the bottom of a U shaped 
        valley between two mountain ranges. We hiked up the slope zigzagging our 
        way up for well over an hour. We then came to a more or less flat area 
        with another higher range farther on and a whole lot of little glaciers 
        in the corners where the land sloped up again. We started to see lots 
        of snow and walked through quite a lot of it. After passing a large glacier-melt 
        pool, we ate lunch on a stony rise. After lunch, we continued to hike 
        horizontally to the upper mountain range. After about a half-hour of that, 
        we started back down the mountain. We had fun on the way down by throwing 
        snowballs we had scooped out of the occasional patches of snow at each 
        other. After we reached the bottom, we crossed the main road that we had 
        come in on and went to the opposite end of the valley. There we visited 
        a tall and powerful waterfall, Takakkaw Falls, that, because of an outcropping 
        of rock fell for a short ways and then shot out and up into the air. This 
        caused an enormous amount of spray and looked cool. We then hiked back 
        up the road to the car. Another worthwhile day. </p>
