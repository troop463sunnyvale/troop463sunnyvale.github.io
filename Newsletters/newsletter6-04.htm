      Todd</p>
      <p> Hello! This is Todd Oatman, patrol leader of the Elemental Patrol. Right now we have six patrol members; they are Erich Schroeder, Matthew Pietfield, Spencer Jones, Sean Keating and Tyler Patrick. All the outings we&rsquo;ve been on have been fun. The scouts and I have learned many useful skills on our outings and have gotten requirements done. Many of my scouts are about to advance in rank, but need a requirement or two before advancing. There are also a few scouts advancing at this Court of Honor. I&rsquo;d like to congratulate the Elemental Patrol for working so hard and for cooperating so much! </p>

      <p>You&rsquo;re reading a patrol report by Aaron Engelberg. My patrol now consists of David, Nick, Tommy, and my assistant patrol leader, Sean. My patrol has been doing great. I was very surprised when the people in my patrol got ready at least a half in hour before the rest of the patrols. I am proud of Sean for getting first class and David for getting Tenderfoot. Nick helped me a lot during the meeting and stuck with his job. Tommy has been very interested in boy scouts and always pays attention during the lessons. I was very proud of the boys when they got second place at Camporee. They are working together and we are off to a good and smooth start of our year. I hope to see all of you guys get the rank at the next Court Of Honor. See you there! </p></td>

Chris<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Know Nothing Patrol is this Court of Honor&rsquo;s Honor Patrol. We rock!! We won by a whopping 100 points. The Know Nothing Patrol is lead by Chris Corley, patrol leader, and Benjamin Tan, assistant patrol leader. The members of the patrol are Matthew Root, Ed Yetso, Bryce Caudle and Justin Gronet.<br>
        We went through two name changes before we became the Know Nothing Patrol. The first name we chose was the Flaming Scouts. We chose it because it sounded really funny and a lot of people in our troop like fire. But the senior patrol rejected it. We then decided to go with The Fruits because Daniel kept calling people fruits. The senior patrol accepted it at first, but then a week later, they rejected it. The next meeting we decided that since we didn&rsquo;t know what to call ourselves, we didn&rsquo;t know nothing, so we called ourselves the &ldquo;Know Nothing Patrol.&rdquo;<br>
        Three people in the patrol are getting rank. Bryce and Justin are getting Scout. Chris is getting First Class. Chris upheld the tradition of the troop by not passing First Class cooking the first time, but he did pass it the second time. So if you want to try and be the one to break the tradition, you&rsquo;ll have to try really hard.</p></td>

          March 13-14, 2004<br>
        Aaron</p>
        <p align="left">All of the leaders gathered at the church early in the morning and as usual, got ready and set off to a weekend of much planning for the year ahead. Derek showed up late, so Mr. Pappay waited and started off late. <br>
  We first got there early so the people at our campsite hadn&rsquo;t moved yet. So we sat down at a nearby picnic table and the younger scouts started off by saying what they thought of the troop so far and what they expected out of the troop. After we got done with this, the older scouts said what their impressions over the years have been. Brian wrote down all of our thoughts after soaking the whiteboard in water. <br>
  When we finished this, they let us relax for a little bit, then called us back so we could get set up at our camp. Then we played some football or just relaxed. We got back and discussed what makes a good leader and the good and bad from the past leaders. During this (since the adults cooked), we were supplied with many chips and snacks. <br>
  Summer camp was the next subject on our agendas. We talked on how there was not a lot of leadership and knew this by the many boys roaming around. We discussed the matter of picking tents and division of labor of the stewards.<br>
  Then we had lunch and played some football again. After we had gotten focused again, we talked about the responsibilities of a patrol leader. We discussed many subjects such as getting things done on outings and making sure our patrol is on task. They made this job seem very hard and Mr. Thurgate emphasized how big of a step this was. They told us the reason </p>
      </div>
      </td>
    <td valign="middle"> 
      <div align="center"> 
        <p align="left">for us to be patrol leader is because it would be better for us to learn the job with support. If we had waited any longer, it would be like being thrown in the pool and being told to swim.<br>
          Next we examined discipline. We thought that the older scouts were not handling authority well and the steps of discipline during a meeting.<br>
Next we talked about advancement. We were reminded that you had to be at least First Class to sign off requirements. The only way to sign off a requirement on the topic of that night&rsquo;s skills instruction is to do it prior to the instruction. This is because we prefer to have a week between learning a skill and signing it off. Mr. Thurgate will be the only one to sign off Second Class map and compass and First Class cooking. <br>
Mr. Tan talked to us about High Adventure. We came up with ideas such as horse back riding, dune bugging, and paint ball. Then we took votes and the top five or ten ones were chosen. He reminded us you have to be at least First Class to attend this.<br>
Next on our agenda was nothing! We got to just play lots of touch football and the adults cooked us chicken cacciatore with rice. This was very nice because since I am vegetarian, they cooked me a separate tofu cacciatore. We put all this over rice. It was wonderful. For dessert we had brownies and some sort of pies topped with whipped cream. This whole time we had potatoes wrapped in tin foil sitting in a fire. If any of us were still hungry, which a few others and I were, we could have these baked potatoes.<br>
After we did this and the fire was out, we were all in our sleeping bags resting from the long day.<br>
We woke up to the sound of a bugle playing right near the SPL&rsquo;s tent.We later were cracking up from hearing that Chris brought a recording and played it right against the older scouts&rsquo; tent. <br>
We planned next year&rsquo;s outings and did a PLC meeting after a delicious omelet breakfast. Then we packed up and did police lines. Even though this was a special outing, we still left it better looking than when we came.<br>
We decided to go down to the lake where many people were playing. Then we jumped back in our cars and went home after a very fun outing, with good meals.</p>

      Derek</p>
      <p> It was as early as 6:55 when I woke up on that promising Saturday morning. Now you may think that that&rsquo;s not so bad for going on a 2-day trip and trying to get as much time as possible out of it. However the truth is, I was supposed to be there by 6:30, or some absurd hour like that. Now that I think back on it, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have planned the trip that early, but as it turned out, we really needed it planned earlier, even if I was late. Here is how my dismal tail begins: <br>
  After I arrived late, the atmosphere was all bustling about, and scrambling to get going. My lateness was not such a good thing for this trip, especially considering it being one of my first trips as the new SPL. Not at all a good thing, but I can assure the troop that this shouldn&rsquo;t happen ever again, mostly due to terrible threats from my parents, who happed to be the unfortunate recipients of a call at 6:50 in the morning&hellip; on a Saturday. (I am astonished to report that I haven&rsquo;t become metabolically challenged yet).<br>
  Once we actually got into the cars, the ride wasn&rsquo;t extensive. However as unwisely unpredicted by the senior patrol, the younger scouts had some difficulties with the management of their gear. Unfortunately this created a &ldquo;miner&rdquo; postponement to the preceding of the trip. Yes indeed, we ended up waiting no less than an hour longer than necessary before the SPL could get his &ldquo;stuff together&rdquo; and organize the younger scouts into actively participating in the processes</p>
    <p style='text-align:justify;'>&nbsp;</p>    </td>
    <td> 
      <p align="left">of unloading and gearing up for their extensive 1 mile hike. Yes there were many of those who thought we would never get there, but due to our amazing SPL we even beat those on the sailboat. (Granted the wind was uncooperative and thus gave the sailboat a handicap). <br>
It would have been pretty hard for the trip to go downhill from there, so I am glad to report that the rest of it went rather smoothly in comparison. The scouts went about pitching their tents with only minor complaints. Then they got to eat lunch and have some time to play and sort out their plans to get requirements signed off. After lunch the senior patrol split up to each teach the scouts some requirements: we did a flag ceremony and properly taught them how to raise and lower the flag. There was fire building, and the proper safety, use, sharpening techniques, and handling of tools such as pocketknives, hatchets, axes, and saws. Along with whatever else the scouts needed to get signed off. These activities went on till around dinnertime, as well as sailing and fishing. <br>
After the scouts finished dinner, and cleaned up (which also took quite a bit longer than necessary), the scouts then either gathered around a campfire where they mysteriously got a hold of several packets of marshmallows and from that point on until they went to bed, many scouts ran around in a very hyper state or went fishing. (This was the best time for fishing seeing as it was dark and the fish are more active at dusk). A couple adults actually caught some fish suitable for eating which were cooked up later that evening.<br>
The next day also took much more time then necessary to get properly packed up. We did police lines for a while, but eventually they got the hang of it. (We are still devising a strategy that will most effectively accomplish this task). We managed to leave at a reasonable time in comparison to the sluggish rate at which this trip initially began.<br>
All in all, the trip put the troop through some very valuable exorcizes that really showed us the areas in which we are most insubstantial. It was better to have these crises now than later (such as on the actual back packing trip, which is 4 days long).</td>

    <p>During the weekend of May 22, the troop attended the annual district Camporee at Camp Chesboro. For anyone who has never been to a Camporee, it is an outing where all the troops in our district have their patrols compete in various events. In the morning the weather was very wet, and we were all worried about camping in the rain. When we arrived at Chesboro, many troops were already setting up camp. The first thing we did, even before setting up camp, was to go through a uniform inspection. Unfortunately, since it took us a little longer to set up camp, our patrols got to the events a little late. The events focused on the things that scouts should know, such as orienteering, first aid, lashings, and even cooking. Like at our troop meetings, the patrols are graded on leadership, completion, and spirit. There was even a troop competition that allowed the senior scouts to help out the patrols. This event was a three-legged relay race of 10 people, where each pair had to carry a bucket of water, while spilling as little as possible. Along with the troop competition, </p></td>
    <td valign="top"> 
      <p align="left">the patrols could earn more points by creating a skit and presenting it to the staff. Unfortunately, none of the skits from our troop were chosen to be presented at the campfire. Although none of our patrols presented anything at the campfire, Mr. Papay represented the troop well by leading the camp in a song. The following morning we received the results of the competitions. Our patrols did well, with the Know-Nothings and Elementals receiving third place ribbons and the Killer Gerbils receiving a second place ribbon. These feats were even more impressive since many of the other patrols were a lot older with more experience in the Camporee environment. Although I didn&rsquo;t directly participate in the events, it appeared that everyone had a good time, I hope that all of you will return next year to improve on what you were able to accomplish this year. Congratulations to all the patrols and remember to continue practicing your skills for the Camporee next year.<br>
