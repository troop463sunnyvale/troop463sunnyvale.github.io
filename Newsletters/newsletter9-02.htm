              <p> A lot of things have happened during and after the summer- I 
                went on the Hawaii trip, almost the whole patrol went to summer 
                camp, and there were advancements by everyone. First things first- 
                our patrol needs a new patrol flag, since the last one died a 
                horrible death at the Camporee. So that&#146;s one thing we&#146;re 
                working on, in addition to getting the Scouts advancement in rank. 
                Congratulations goes out to Alex, who will be getting his Second 
                Class at the next Court of Honor, and Daniel (the Assistant Patrol 
                Leader) who got into the Order of the Arrow (Remember my previous 
                information on that? Yes&#133;you know you want to join!). Now 
                that Scouts is back full-time for the year, I look forward to 
                advancing the scouts up and teaching them new skills. Well, that&#146;s 
                the Sharks&#146; status&#133;until next time, this is the patrol 
                leader Bryant Look, signing off&#133;</p>

              <p align="left">The Falcon patrol is starting off with a new burst 
                of vigor and optimism. They have begun much this New Year with 
                a new goal: to work together and excel in rank. We&#146;ve been 
                working on working together and now is our time to pull our selves 
                together and try to achieve more then our expectations. <br>
                It is time to move on with our scouting ways and go for the hights 
                and have fun. We are all exited to start the New Year and learn 
                new things and become a more effective team or patrol. So far 
                we have started out on the right foot and plan to proceed with 
                speed and understanding. As eagles we are on our way to the top. 
                <br>
                What I have seen in these few short weeks has been exceptional. 
                I have seen less anger and frustration between scouts and more 
                understanding and more enjoyable relationships. There has been 
                more cooperation and tolerance for each other.<br>
                This gives me hope for even more incredible progress through the 
                rest of the year. If it continues on like this or better, I&#146;m 
                sure anything is possible, and rank seems easily probable. I am 
                impressed and plan to begin by saying that there will be a further 
                endeavor to promote rank among the patrol as yet. <br>
                That&#146;s all there is for now because the year is just beginning. 
                The future must be recognized for now and acted upon shortly.</p>

            <p>Hi! This is your SPL James Enomoto, and I hope you all had a fun 
              and productive summer.&nbsp;Now that you are back, we will be working 
              hard on getting you guys to advance.&nbsp;In order for us to do 
              this, we need you to come to us when you need something signed off.&nbsp;If 
              you really want or need more time to work on your advancement, talk 
              to your patrol leaders and keep reminding them that you want a patrol 
              meeting.&nbsp;All of the Senior Patrol would also greatly appreciate 
              it if the younger scouts would try to listen, pay more attention, 
              and fool around less during our discussions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
              <br>
              For all of you scouts that went to summer camp, I hope you all had 
              a fun time and got a lot done.&nbsp;Remember that if you didn&#146;t 
              complete a merit badge and have a partial, you can find a counselor 
              in this area and finish it up. Everyone else that didn&#146;t go 
              to summer camp, I hope that you will be there next year. I think 
              this will be a great year for this troop.&nbsp;I would like to see 
              all of you at the Scout-O-Rama so we can display the skills we have 
              learned and get more people to join us.&nbsp;For the rest of our 
              Troop 463 year, we have many fun outings and activities planned 
              so come, have fun, and accomplish a lot towards your ranks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p align="center">Yosemite Backpacking<br>
              6/16-20/02<br>
              Bryant</p>
            <p>Ahhh&#133;backpacking. Going up and down hills, walking for miles 
              and miles, all with around forty pounds on your back. It seems to 
              be the &#145;ultimate&#146; camping experience. This summer, as 
              a prep trip for Hawaii, four adventurous scouts and two brave adults 
              went on a grueling backpacking trip in picturesque Yosemite.<br>
              The first night was easy; we found our campsite and slept under 
              the stars. The next morning, it was a quick cereal breakfast and 
              then a car drive to the trail. The hike started out easy enough, 
              hiking over relatively flat ground on dirt paths. After an hour 
              or two of that, however, we started going down the dreaded switchbacks. 
              Switchbacks are basically zigzags downhill, which are supposed to 
              make hiking easier by not having you go downhill at a very steep 
              angle. In theory, this works perfectly; in real life, I wished I 
              could have just slid down the hill on my back, rather than go down 
              the 100+ switchbacks. After around two hours just getting down the 
              hill, I realized there was still a good amount of trail to cover. 
              It took me another 3 or 4 hours to get to the camp, where most of 
              the other people were waiting. We ate a freeze-dried dinner, hung 
              up the food, maybe soaked our feet in the chilly river, and collapsed 
              in the tents. <br>
              The following day was a rest period for our bodies; almost everyone 
              lied around camp, recuperating from the previous day. I say almost 
              because the Thurgates actually went on a day hike for several hours. 
              So there was not much activity the second day, merely rest and the 
              relaxation of our feet in the numbing river. <br>
              The third day was a punishing hike over one of the cruelest hills 
              in the entire world. I kid you not, that </p>

            <p align="left">hill was most definitely spiteful and bitter. We started 
              the day off with a quick breakfast and got on the trail. The first 
              couple miles were deceptively easy, with barely any elevation climb. 
              Then came the small ridges, which were moderately difficult, but 
              nothing to panic about. Finally, four of us (the Thurgates were 
              far ahead, for basically the entire trip) reached a fairly big elevation 
              climb, which had our knees aching quite a bit and the sweat pouring 
              down. Finally, we reached a part where we could see what was ahead- 
              and we groaned-very loudly. There was a giant MOUNTAIN looming ahead. 
              The long journey up the gargantuan took several hours at least, 
              with more cruel surprises at every switchback. Every time you thought 
              you could see the top, you merely reached that point and discovered 
              it was yet another false top. When I finally reached the top, I 
              shouted for joy and started running down. A hour or so later, we 
              finally reached the place the Thurgates had set up, finally enabling 
              us to drop our burdens and get away from the mosquitoes. (Since 
              I haven&#146;t mentioned them yet, I will here- there were many, 
              MANY mosquitoes)<br>
              The fourth day was the one that had the best scenery, and also the 
              most confusing hike. The hike started out easy, dipping through 
              some watery marshes and through some mercifully shady forest paths. 
              Right before I reached the gigantic hill that led up to the waterfall, 
              I finally caught up to Brian. We started the long journey up the 
              hill, which was incredibly taxing on your strength. Mr. Thurgate 
              passed me on the way up to the waterfall, and continued ahead. I 
              eventually reached the top where the Thurgates waited, and after 
              a short rest, we took off. (Note: the waterfall was beautiful, you 
              could see two rainbows from the top of it) Now, the Thurgates got 
              far ahead of me, while Mr. Enomoto, James, and Karl were far behind 
              me. I didn&#146;t have that much trouble following the relatively 
              easy trail, except at this huge marshy place where water was everywhere. 
              I finally got to the end of the trail, climbed yet another giant 
              hill, and I was at Camp Glenn Aulin. The only problem was that I 
              didn&#146;t know what campsite number we were in. To make things 
              worse, my walkie-talkie broke. To cap off the events, one of the 
              bolts in my backpack fell out, making one strap unusable (YOU try 
              carrying 40 pounds on ONE strap). So I ended up waiting an hour 
              for James, Karl, and Mr. Enomoto to </p>

                and got ready for the return trip. <br>
                The following day was quite an anomaly for the trip, as we covered 
                five miles in a few hours (most other hikes took around 6 hours 
                at least, although the last day was all easy hiking). After the 
                short hike back, we waited at the Yosemite Post Office for the 
                shuttle bus. It finally arrived after a few hours of waiting, 
                and we took a short 30-mile hop to our cars, where we then took 
                the long but relaxing trip back home. </p>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Our High Adventure trip 
                that included Brian Thurgate, Bryant Look, James Enomoto, Mr. 
                Look, and Mr. Thurgate began with a trip to the Thurgate&#146;s 
                house at 3:30 AM on June 28, 2002. Mrs. Thurgate drove us to Oakland 
                International Airport, where we departed at 7:25 AM. After the 
                long plane ride to Kauai, we finally arrived at about 9:40 AM. 
                (Hawaiian time) Once we got there, we picked up our van and all 
                our supplies before heading to our first campsite at Kokee State 
                Park. <br>
                The next day we woke up very early with the help of some local 
                roosters. After breakfast, we proceeded to go on a hike where 
                we enjoyed many great views of the local scenery, including some

                left on another hike. This was one of the most painful hikes of 
                the trip. Not only was it a moderately hard hike, we also had 
                to walk through some thorny berry bushes all along the trail. 
                Although some of us didn&#146;t enjoy these bushes, Brian and 
                Mr. Look really enjoyed eating the berries they picked. After 
                a couple of hours we arrived at our destination. From this point 
                we walked off the trail, out of the trees, and onto a cliff with 
                steep drops on both sides. We were able to get a great view of 
                two waterfalls that flowed into some pools below. The part that 
                Bryant liked the most was not the waterfalls, but the sight of 
                a goat with her two calves. <br>
                When we woke up the next morning, we once again packed up and 
                went on a short hike before arriving at our next campsite (Anini 
                Beach). We were all surprised to see something&nbsp; pretty unusual, 
                a polo game being played across the street from our campsite. 
                After the game, we finally got an opportunity to get into the 
                water and go snorkeling. Although Bryant and I didn&#146;t go 
                out as far as Brian and Mr. Thurgate, we still got to see lots 
                of colorful fish, while they were lucky enough to observe a sea 
                turtle. Later, during dinner, Bryant snapped his braces and couldn&#146;t 
                go snorkeling with the rest of us the next day. <br>
                While Bryant and Mr. Look were gone for the brace repairs, I had 
                a lot of fun with Brian and Mr. Thurgate, going snorkeling twice 
                and observing many more colorful fish. While driving between beaches, 
                we also visited some really neat caves. When we got back that 
                night we went to a Lu&#146;au. There was a lot of good food including 
                kalua pig and the very interesting and unique poi. During dinner, 
                hula dancers and live music entertained us. We all had a good 
                time and would like to do it again. <br>
                On our last day, we took the best known of all our hikes on Kauai 
                to the &#147;Sleeping Giant &#147;. Even though the hike took 
                us awhile, the view from the top was well worth it. We were able 
                to see most of the island, and its amazing scenery. That night 
                we stayed at the Garden Island Hotel and packed for our upcoming 
                flight to the Big Island of Hawaii, the next morning. When we 
                arrived on the Big Island we got our van and drove off to what 
                would be our home for the next 5 days,Volcano National Park.</p>

              lava-which was very interesting. In Hawaii, they must not be awfully 
              concerned about the dangers of hot molten lava, since you could 
              walk on top of the lava if you felt that desire. In the daytime, 
              lava was not that impressive, as it was a gray shade on the top 
              and you could only see a rather faint red when it moved. The real 
              attraction came later that night, where we went back to the same 
              place to see the lava in the dark. It was an eerie feeling, watching 
              the crimson glow against the blackness of the night. Dozens of other 
              people had come out to see the lava, which was flowing much faster 
              in the nighttime. To illustrate how hot the lava was to you, the 
              reader, I brought two long sticks with me when we went at night. 
              I threw one right in front of the lava, as Brian also did, and we 
              watched as the sticks erupted into flame and burnt out. It was a 
              very cool experience, something different than just fireworks on 
              the Fourth of July.<br>
              July 5-6- These two days are somewhat of a blur, since I can distinctly 
              remember only one thing about them: hiking. Typically, we&#146;d 
              eat breakfast in the morning, throw our daypacks in the van and 
              get on the road. The day would usually be one long day hike supplemented 
              by several short ones, all with the intent of seeing something extraordinary 
              in nature. One of the days we took an extremely exhausting hike 
              through one of the worst trails ever created. The trail offered 
              a &#147;spectacular view of the volcano&#148;, according to the 
              guidebook. Something the guidebook failed to mention was what a 
              bad shape the trail was in. Throughout the 6-7 hour hike, there 
              was rain, making the trail even muddier than </p>

            <p align="left">before, if possible. Most of the hike was spent jumping 
              from tree root to tree root, rather than walking on solid ground. 
              Only the Thurgates went the whole trail length; the rest of us were 
              too tired from slogging through the mud (you know what I said about 
              the tree roots? There weren&#146;t always tree roots to land on). 
              Another day we took a much more gratifying hike through this valley 
              that had steam vents and fairly deep crevice. The winds were high 
              in the valley, causing a chill; but the sight of the huge crater 
              (before we entered the valley) and the warm steam vents was worth 
              it. <br>
              July 7- This day was spent in Kona, viewing some of its historical 
              places and tourist shops. Brian went on a nighttime Manta Ray scuba 
              dive, while the rest of the group camped out on the beach. We basically 
              just cooked dinner and rested, although I body surfed the waves 
              a little (well, maybe more got beaten down by the waves). <br>
              July 8- Ahh&#133;the day of the scuba dive! James, Brian, and I 
              woke up in the morning and got ready for our trip into the ocean. 
              The adults saw us off from the scuba shop, and then went into town 
              while we went out to sea. James and I, beginning scuba divers, went 
              into one dive group while Brian went into a different one. (For 
              those reasons, I can only write about my experience). The instructor 
              went over some basic scuba actions, and then we got into the water 
              and practiced them (One thing I haven&#146;t mentioned yet-Hawaii 
              water is WARM, as in heated swimming pool warm). When we went down 
              for our first dive, I was thoroughly excited. We went as deep as 
              30 feet on the first dive, and we looked at the different sea animals 
              and plants. After our oxygen got to low, we came back up, had lunch, 
              and went to another dive site. The second time, we saw more interesting 
              things, went lower (40 feet), and stayed down longer. Undersea, 
              there are so many bright and colorful creatures, you just can&#146;t 
              fully describe it. One thing I can say we saw were some small eels 
              and a sea turtle that was lying on the ocean floor. <br>
              After we got back from the scuba diving, we went to a campsite by 
              the beach. During the ride, we noticed people spelled things out 
              with white rocks on the hillsides (pretty entertaining). We had 
              a last good meal before backpacking (steak and potatoes), distributed 
              the group gear and rearranged our packs, and finally went to sleep.

              Brian</p>
            <p>We woke up early on the 9th in order to get an early start on backpacking. 
              We couldn&#146;t park at the overlook, so we dropped off the packs, 
              then my dad went back and dropped off the car. It was a very long 
              descent into Waimanu valley, 900 vertical feet in a very short distance. 
              By the bottom, we were already tired, and we still had a climb of 
              1200 feet 8 miles and a descent of 1200 feet. At the bottom of Waimanu 
              valley, there was a river, a very big river. We tried finding a 
              crossing, by wading in without our backpacks, but we were unable 
              to get across since the river was swelled by rainwater. We enlisted 
              the help of an inflatable boat for a small fee of $20. This covered 
              all of us and our gear. We worried a little that we wouldn&#146;t 
              be able to get a ride back across but decided to try anyway. We 
              then had a grueling 1200-foot climb, which afforded great views, 
              but also took a lot of energy. By the time we got to the top of 
              the ridge between the two valleys, some of us were ready to go back. 
              However, we persisted and fourteen small valleys, about two-hundred 
              foot rises and dips, and about six hours later we were finally to 
              the top of Waipi&#146;o valley. It was beautiful. It was a very 
              long decent but it afforded some awesome views. The whole thing 
              was amazing. Given the recent downpours, the waterfalls were flowing 
              amazingly well. In Waipi&#146;o valley, we had another river to 
              cross. Although we may have been able to, we decided not to try 
              since we were worried about getting stuck on the other side. It 
              was pretty late when we finally got camp set-up so we didn&#146;t 
              do much the rest of the day.<br>
              The second day of our backpacking trip was a layover day. First, 
              we decided to try and rig something to help a group who had crossed 
              the river, then when it </p>

              We rigged a surfboard like boogey board with some &frac14; inch 
              ropes. We tied one to the boogey board and a tree upriver so the 
              board would not get swept downstream, and another two we put across 
              the river so each side had an end to pull to bring it back and forth 
              from shore to shore. This way, by simply lying on the board, we 
              could be pulled across the river by someone on the other side. We 
              then went off to the beach and played in the waves. We all had a 
              lot of fun, especially James. At the beach, there was a rip tide, 
              which was very annoying since it meant that we had to stay close 
              to shore. James accidentally let himself get out a little far and 
              had a hard time getting back in. After lunch, James, Bryant, and 
              Mr. Look remained at camp while my dad and I went to see the waterfall. 
              It was a fairly short walk and we soon were underneath it. It was 
              very cool, and the mist from it enveloped the forest for hundreds 
              of feet. When we went back, the other group was packing up. They 
              were a day late leaving and they wanted to get across the river. 
              We ended up helping them cross, with me carrying their packs on 
              the boogy boardish thing, and James, Bryant, and my dad taking turns 
              pulling the rope to get me across. After all the packs were across 
              the members of the group ferried across. After the crossing was 
              done, they continued up the hill to camp at a shelter and we had 
              dinner and went to sleep.<br>
              The third and final day of the backpacking trip, we hiked out, starting 
              with the 1200 foot climb, along the ridge, then 1200 feet down the 
              other side, then after hiking 9 miles we had another climb this 
              one of 900 feet. In spite of the fact that we had more up on the 
              way out, we went much faster. We got to Waimanu valley by lunch. 
              After wading the river, we ate lunch. The river had gone down substantially, 
              so that it was only up to our waists. After reaching the top and 
              getting the car, we went shopping for some perishable food items, 
              drove to our campsite, then past it. We weren&#146;t lost though; 
              we just went to see some sites up the road. We saw two really neat, 
              tall waterfalls, and then had some tasty Hawaiian ice cream. We 
              then went to camp, had dinner, and went to sleep.<br>
              The next day we were in a little bit of a hurry since we had to 
              get to the hotel and then return the van by ten. We succeeded and

                a 2003 so far before the change of 2002, but we were happy. It 
                was a lot bigger than we had expected. We then went up to Mauna 
                Loa and Mauna Kea. On the way up, we stopped at some caves which 
                extended for miles underground. All of us except Mr. Look, went 
                in to explore them, and although we sure didn&#146;t go the whole 
                way, (walking in them is pretty slow,) it was a lot of fun. We 
                didn&#146;t spend much time here since we needed to get to Mauna 
                Kea before it got dark. We then drove up Mona Loa, a very interesting 
                ride. It was a one lane paved road with lots of turns and ups 
                and downs. When we went over the little hillish things going fast 
                it was like a roller coaster and the ice chest in back kept becoming 
                airborne. When we were nearly at the top, one of our bags of Doritos 
                popped open from the lack of air pressure around it. We didn&#146;t 
                go to the top since it was a ten-mile or so hike and we didn&#146;t 
                have the time or the desire (at 11,000 feet it is a lot harder 
                to hike). There was a neat view of Mauna Kea from the end of the 
                road, but not much else of interest. Next we went to the visitor 
                center on Mauna Kea. There were some neat exhibits and facts there 
                but we didn&#146;t spend a whole lot of time, since we wanted 
                to do a little exploring before sunset. We looked around on the 
                top a little driving to different telescopes (although they were 
                all already closed to visitors). Then James, my dad, and I went 
                on a hike to the highest lake in the world. It was fed by permafrost. 
                It was pretty neat, and although only half a mile away it was 
                very difficult at 13,000 feet. The water was very cold and not 
                clear at all. It was easy to see why the natives used to think 
                that it was hundreds of feet deep . . . in reality it was only 
                about 9 ft deep! We barely got back to the car in time for sunset. 
                We drove up the road a little to watch a very panoramic sunset. 
                We then ate dinner, and looked at the stars a little before going 
                down to the visitor center. At the visitor center some of us looked 
                through the telescopes at the stars. . . and . . . they didn&#146;t 
                twinkle. It had excellent views of them and some nebulas. We then 
                returned to the hotel.<br>
                Our last full day in Hawaii, we spent seeing a couple of sights, 
                such as Pep&#146;epe Falls, Rainbow Falls, the freshest cleanest 
                air on earth, and a very interesting, naturally fed and heated 
                swimming pond. We also drove out to the lava flow from the Hilo

              <p> Our troop went to Glacial Trails this year for summer camp. 
                It was, as always, endlessly fun, although maybe not as spectacularly 
                amazing as some of the other camps we&#146;ve been to. At first, 
                it wasn&#146;t that great; we brought in our own tents since the 
                camp didn&#146;t provide tentage. Also, the first meal was suspected 
                by some to have been made of the same primordial ooze from which 
                life first arose on Earth (I didn&#146;t think it was too bad, 
                but anyway&#133;). Later, they seemed to get their act together 
                a bit (in my opinion, the only opinion that matters), improving 
                their food and starting merit badge sessions. The instructors, 
                as always, were great: funny, nice, helpful, etc. We all (as you 
                can tell from the long Court of Honor ceremony) got a lot of merit 
                badges, and had a lot of fun doing so. I found that (most of) 
                the counselors actually made you do work at this camp. Also, they 
                organized the merit badges interestingly &#150; only 1 merit badge 
                per day, but you finish it completely in that day. </p>

              <p align="left">Next, there were the activities. Some of the memorable 
                activities included a staff hunt, where you look for as many hidden 
                staff as you can throughout the camp (in which AJ found our only 
                staff member, the medic &#150; an extremely friendly and fun guy); 
                a who-can-make-the-best-cobbler contest (which we didn&#146;t 
                win, but at which Brian and David made a valiant attempt; in any 
                case, we got to eat our chocolate-cherry cobbler&#133; it was 
                good); 3 amazing, incredibly funny, well-performed campfires, 
                in which the best act in most people&#146;s opinion was &#147;This 
                Ol Cardboard Box, with Hobo Joe;&#148; a lost mine hike for younger 
                scouts, where they went off inside a &#145;lost mine&#146; &#150; 
                a mine that wasn&#146;t on any maps; a mountain man thingy where 
                we shot a black powder rifle, some people threw tomahawks, and 
                David recited his &#145;tizIGHT&#146; Original Prose / Poetry

                decided that it would be a good idea to wake up at about 5:00 
                AM every day and go jump in the ice-cold lake; a day hike to and 
                from &#145;lake 6(?),&#146; another of the 13 lakes around the 
                Glacial Trails, where most of us jumped off an adjacent ~30-foot 
                cliff into the lake (this one was a lot warmer); and an uber-leet 
                Brotherhood OA ceremony where Brian and David got Brotherhood.<br>
                Some other interesting things, Brian and David woke up early one 
                day to go see the sunrise over the lake. HOLY WOW IT WAS AMAZING. 
                Yellow sun piercing over the horizon, white mist flowing ethereally 
                over lake, purple-orange-yellow haze of the distant sky, and green 
                trees and gray rock in the next valley over. Lets see. And also, 
                Troop 463 REVIVED THE TROOP CHEER. Hmmm&#133; well in any case 
                we had an amazingly fun time. Yeah. I&#146;ll end on that note.

              <p>That&#146;s right! This was our annual fun &#147;summer&#148; 
                beach trip and it was&#133; tremendously excellent! The trip took 
                place on August 31 to September 2 to MacKerricher Park. MacKerricher 
                Park is a beautiful Northern California coastal park. It had excellent 
                lavatory facilities and many cool shady campgrounds. <br>
                The drive up was long and foggy. (I don&#146;t envy the drivers: 
                5 hour drive) Most of the scouts slept or read. It was a fairly 
                quiet and relaxed drive. When we arrived at the park (around 1:30) 
                we circled it several times and picked out a couple campgrounds 
                close together and big enough to accommodate all of our dedicated 
                scouts. <br>
                Once we were settled and the camp was set up, we all wanted to 
                play on the beach, and so we did. We hiked up north along the 
                sandy dunes by the ocean and found a great place to stop and play. 
                The waves were immense (unusually oversized for this time of year). 
                Some scouts found delight in rolling a huge log into the waves 
                and having the waves push it back. Trying our hardest no one could 
                get it out to sea. Then many of us played a terrific game of football 
                on the dunes; others simply buried the younger scouts up to their 
                necks (with their consent). Then it was evening and time to cook 
                dinner. So we returned, many of us drenched in seawater. <br>
                It turns out that the patrols excellent menu plans happened to 
                be the same. But of course, each patrol forgot small essentials 
                but was supplied by the other. For all meals, the patrols were 
                a little slow on the cleaning, but everyone was having a good 
                time participating. <br>

              <p align="left">After dinner, we all went to a campfire open to 
                all campers. The instructor led us all in some songs and information 
                about the beach and general area. Then he gave us a great slide 
                presentation of the different bird species, which inhabited the 
                area. It told us of all the general survival techniques of all 
                the different species. <br>
                Then it was time for bed, after the long exhausting day, we welcomed 
                this satisfying rest. The next day we all got up early and started 
                to cook breakfast (which was the same for each patrol). By about 
                9:30, we headed south along the coast on our 5-mile hike, lead 
                by two of the scouts using a map and compass to guide us for a 
                requirement. We all walked along the coast, sometimes on cliff 
                edges, enjoying the view, and sometimes along the shore enjoying 
                the beach and waves. Today the winds had died down and the waves 
                were not so big. We spotted many of the bird life shown to us 
                during the slide show. <br>
                We were heading toward Fort Bragg and stopped short of it about 
                a mile or two. There we stayed on the beach and many of the scouts 
                played in the numbing cold surge of the waves, while others buried 
                more scouts. We had lunch and played until it was time to leave.<br>
                On the walk back to camp, we stopped at a couple of tide pools 
                and looked at the interesting marine life. On one of the beaches, 
                we found a mostly intact jellyfish and took pictures. It may have 
                still been alive, but would not survive even if brought back to 
                the sea. We got back to camp drenched again, and cleaned up. Then 
                we would all sign off the younger scouts requirements and learn 
                some new things ourselves. In the evening, we cooked our hamburgers, 
                and cleaned up. <br>
                That night we made our own campfire and roasted some marshmallows. 
                Then we all went to our tents and slept. We were all tired from 
                the days adventure. <br>
                The next morning was fast passed and the camp had to be taken 
                down and be litter free before we left. It was about 9:00 before 
                we left the camp better then we found it.<br>
                Our long five hour drive back was much more exciting and social, 
                but many scouts still slept their share before the ride was up. 
                We were stuck many times behind big campers that wouldn&#146;t 
                pull over, but we </p>
