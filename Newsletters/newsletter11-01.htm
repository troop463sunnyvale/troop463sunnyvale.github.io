                James</p>
              <p> Since the last Court of Honor, the Shark Patrol has been busy. 
                We have gone on many outings including the Webelos outing at Del 
                Valle in October. It gave us the opportunity to accomplish many 
                of the scout requirements. The members of the Sharks are steadily 
                progressing in rank with their newly acquired skills. At the weekly 
                troop meetings, we have also been able to focus on some of the 
                activities needed to meet rank requirements. I would like to congratulate 
                two scouts on earning their Tenderfoot rank- Alex and A.J. They 
                have learned a lot and worked hard to get their Tenderfoot. They 
                will now get to proudly wear our unique neckerchief. For everybody 
                who is still trying to get his Tenderfoot make sure you bring 
                your book so you can get stuff signed off. I&#146;m looking forward 
                to the rest of the year as your patrol leader and hope that I 
                can help you get rank. If you want to get things signed off you 
                can call me at (408) 735-7370 and I will help you as best as I 
                can.</p>

              <p>The falcon patrol is doing remarkably well. The patrol is currently 
                trying to help the younger scouts gain rank. The patrol is now 
                mostly leadership and should run smoothly. Getting the rest of

              <p align="left"> patrol should not pose as a serious problem, in 
                fact it should happen quickly. The patrol should pick up a lot 
                of speed at this point and get to the point of were we can just 
                have fun and work on most of the ranks during the outings. The 
                more Falcons that can go on the outings the faster they can get 
                their ranks. The outings become almost crucial for getting to 
                second and first class. I hope the patrol can get to that point 
                soon. Certain scouts have worked very hard and are now at that 
                point the others just need a little more. They only need a little 
                motivation, which the leadership should be able to give. </p>

              <p align="left">A lot of you in the troop don&#146;t know what OA 
                is-or what it stands for. Now I could tell you what it stands 
                for and what we in OA do-but that&#146;s just not the same as 
                experiencing it yourself. Until you join, you&#146;ll never really 
                know if it&#146;s the Orangutan Amphora. So you ask, how do you 
                get to join the OA? Well, you have to be 1st Class, and the troop 
                votes you into OA. That&#146;s great, you say, but why would I 
                want to join it? Let me just say this- OA is like an elite society 
                within the Boy Scouts where you have a lot of fun and help people. 
                If you REALLY want to find out more- talk to Brian Thurgate, David 
                Ho, or James Enomoto. Just kidding- as I am the OA rep, you should 
                probably talk to me. OA helps with the Camporee every year, and 
                they have fellowships, conclave meetings, and huge gatherings. 
                If this goes beyond your understanding, then join OA-you&#146;ll 
                have fun, make new friends, and help people; a win-win-win situation.<br>

              Brian<br>
              7/16-23/01</p>
            <p>Touring before the jamboree was an interesting experience. We visited 
              sites all the way from Boston to Virginia. We went to places like 
              the Liberty Bell, the USS Constitution, George Washington&#146;s 
              house, Williamsburg, the Capitol, the Plymouth Plantation, just 
              to name a few. We arrived in Boston fairly late and didn&#146;t 
              get to our hotel until 12:30 in the morning. Although it sounds 
              fairly late, it was about the average time we&#146;d arrive at our 
              hotels. Most of us didn&#146;t get to sleep on most nights until 
              about 3:00 am. We then would wake up at around 6:30 to go eat breakfast, 
              load the buses and go touring the day&#146;s historical sites. The 
              historical sites were, for the most part, very remarkable, although 
              we could have used a little bit more time at some of them. We spent 
              many a boring hour riding the bus from historical site to historical 
              site, although in defense of the bus ride we did watch some movies. 
              On average we saw . . . well it&#146;s hard to do an average because 
              it varied greatly depending on how you count the sites and the day. 
              My favorite part of the touring was when we visited the Plymouth 
              plantation. I liked it for a couple of reasons. One of the main 
              reasons was that one of the people who lived in the town was my 
              (many greats) grandfather, a blacksmith for the town. Although he 
              wasn&#146;t there it was still neat visiting for that reason. Another 
              was because I got to go around with people outside of my patrol 
              (I wasn&#146;t supposed to but oops) something that always improved 
              the experience for me; I was after all the patrol leader. Seeing 
              all the historical </p>

            <p align="center">sites was cool, but the ones with people acting 
              like the people who lived at them during their hey-day made it a 
              lot cooler. The trip was nearly perfectly timed for me for it was 
              right after eight grade American history where we learnt about many 
              of the sites we visited. Not all of the places we went were historical 
              sites; we also went to Busch Gardens, for those of you who don&#146;t 
              know your east-coast attractions (like me:) Busch Gardens is a theme 
              park. I didn&#146;t enjoy it a lot for 2 reasons, the first is that 
              I don&#146;t like roller coasters a lot, and the second is slightly 
              more complex. Well not really, the second is that we had to go around 
              as a patrol and I was in charge, and a couple people in my patrol 
              (I won&#146;t name them) were very annoying, they wouldn&#146;t 
              listen and kept wandering off, (sort of like some people here the 
              leadership knowsJ). We toured many historical sites, and if you 
              want to here specifics you can ask one of us who went to the totally, 
              completely, absolutely fun Jamboree, but not wanting to take up 
              to much space I won&#146;t go into the details in this paper.</p>

            <p> What a week in July! From shotguns to scuba gear, lightening to 
              fireworks, almost everything imaginable happened at the Jamboree. 
              Everyone was there: Yoda, desert animals, Marvel superheroes, Napster, 
              and the president (he was SUPPOSED to be there). This is a brief 
              description of what two attendees at the National Jamboree 2001 
              experienced: fun, fun, fun! Need more details? Fine, we&#146;ll

              When the bus pulled up to a stop in front of a desolate patch of 
              not-so-green grass, we were awed. Not by the incredible heat, withered 
              grass, or innumerable bugs; it was because of all the things surrounding 
              that space: endless rows of people, tents, and equipment. More than 
              40,000 people were at the Jamboree, and it was amazing how big the 
              whole place was. There were so many things to do that nobody could 
              do all of them. We fired shotguns at clay pigeons, rappelled down 
              tall towers, scuba dived in a three-foot pool, climbed over and 
              under wooden obstacles, nearly got drowned in toilet paper (ask 
              someone about it), had exchanges with other scouts (*cough*PATCHES*cough*), 
              fired bow and arrows, and got (NOT STOLE) lots of free stuff. Oh, 
              and almost froze to death in the cold showers. So many things happened, 
              it would take a huge book to explain all our experiences, especially 
              the strange ones, including an all day thunderstorm in which scouts 
              were struck by lightening, and our gateway (towers acting as entrance 
              to our camp) flattening the tent right next to one of our writers. 
              &nbsp;<br>
              Even our departure from the Jamboree wasn&#146;t normal: it was 
              as exciting as everything that happened at the Jamboree. Because 
              there was a problem on the plane so we had to schedule three different 
              flights to get back home. One group had to go to an airport in North 
              Carolina. Another one of our groups had to catch a flight out of 
              the Dulles airport in Washington D.C. Our last group stayed at the 
              airport in Baltimore and arrived back home first. From beginning 
              to end the Jamboree was non-stop fun and learning experiences. We 
              hope that next time more scouts from troop 463 can enjoy the ride. 
              If you want to know more about the Jamboree talk to Eric Garcia.<br>

                David</p>
              <p align="left">The camp, Marin Sierra, was one of the best camps 
                yet. During that exciting week of summer camp, everyone had a 
                tremendous amount of fun with the patrol, the troop, and with 
                the other scouts there.<br>
                Some important facts: First, the food was actually edible! Second, 
                the lake was actually warm! And third, the counselors were very 
                fun to be around. This made camp Marin Sierra very fun!!! The 
                only really bad thing was that the tents were not very stable 
                and took a lot of maintenance. That got frustrating.<br>
                The camp, Camp Marin-Sierra, had a great variety of both challenging 
                and fun merit badges in many different sections. At the waterfront, 
                my personal favorite area, there were exciting merit badges like: 
                swimming, sailing, lifesaving, and canoeing. The other areas of 
                camp were: nature, handicraft, scoutcraft, and the three shooting 
                ranges. On the shooting ranges, a lot of the Falcon patrol worked 
                on the rifle merit badge. That was probably the most popular merit 
                badge. There was also orienteering, wilderness survival, a lot 
                of nature merit badges, and emergency preparedness, to name few. 
                Finally, for all of the younger scouts, there was a course on 
                the trail to first class to help them along their ranks. <br>
                What really made the camp fun was the competition the camp put 
                up for the troops. For example, some of us did the mile swim and 
                snorkeling at the waterfront. Also, the iron man was a competition 
                of physical strength between all of the patrols. Each patrol chose 
                three representatives. Each person did one of the three legs of 
                the race. The swimmer (Simon Iacob) and the rower (Brian Thurgate) 
                went out to a buoy in the lake, and the runner (David Ho) ran 
                around the lake. Another </p>

                Town,&#146; which included many different competitions. The Sharks 
                patrol won two of these competitions: the misery whip, and the 
                fire bucket brigade. There was a saw game, in which Falcons got 
                second place, there was a canoe race, a water bucket relay, and 
                one or two other thrilling activities. At the end of the week, 
                the counselors put on some great skits for the troops. They sang 
                some songs and all the troops also did small skits of there own 
                for further entertainment. <br>
                Finally, for a service project, our troop participated in helping 
                clear the area to make a new perimeter trail around the lake. 
                In conclusion, this year summer camp was very fun and exciting 
                for everyone. I would love to go back there again especially if 
                we don&#146;t get the furthest camp from the campfire and dining 
                hall. That camp had probably the warmest lake yet!!! But we will 
                most likely go on and try new camps.</p>

              <p align="left">We went to the Lost Coast on Labor Day weekend, 
                for 3 days and 2 nights, car camping. It was ultra-fun, just like 
                I said on the flyer, although it did take 5 hours to get there, 
                during which I did a little world history homework. When we got 
                there, we did a good turn by helping the previous campers get 
                out of the campsite. The campsite wasn&#146;t actually on the 
                beach, but it was pretty, surrounded by trees. The weather was 
                nice; a bit hot, but it was perfect when we were in the shade 
                or on the beach. The first day, we went out and hiked a bit, took 
                a look at the insane view from atop a cliff, and then we hiked 
                back to cook little scouts &#150; </p>

                We didn&#146;t go swimming but we kinda just got our feet (knees, 
                legs, chest, arms, etc.) wet. The waves were awesome. We ate lunch 
                at this big rock and later played football on the beach. On the 
                trip back, I finally finished my world history homework.</p>

              <p>Webelos Outing<br>

              <p align="left">Swarms of gnats. Large (structural integrity questionable) 
                tower. Fire. Food. Boat. Little kids. What do all these things 
                to do with each other, besides all containing vowels? Well, they 
                were all present and accounted for at the Webelos Outing on October 
                20-21, a fun outing and reasonably well-controlled outing despite 
                only four Leadership scouts at the outing. (There were six, but 
                one arrived late and another magically disappeared) While most 
                of the troop toiled over a high tower made of poles and rope for 
                over five hours without a break (at least SOME of us did), the 
                Webelos got to know how much fun our troop was by fishing and 
                taking long boat rides. After everyone took a climb up the extremely 
                sturdy tower, it was free time! People scampered around trees, 
                played with cattails, and took long boat rides involving cows, 
                fishermen, submarines, and circles. (For more details, contact 
                the all mighty scribe Eric Garcia) The day was closed out with 
                a large pot of spaghetti, some fire, skits, and a whole lot of 
                mayhem. What really matters, however, is that the Webelos had 
                a fun time; they got acquainted with the fine young men who will 
                hopefully become their fellow scouts in the future. <br>

              <p>Wow&#146; What a storm! Thunderbolts everywhere! Well this article 
                falls on the heels of the highlight of the month for us - a camp 
                out with the Boy Scouts of Troop 463. We camped at a great spot 
                on the shore of Lake Del Valle. Our gear was carried across the 
                lake on an eight-seater patio boat, but we hiked to the site, 
                along side the lake, and the view was beautiful. While camping 
                we watched Troop 463 construct a tower made of poles and lashings. 
                It had a platform on top and Old Glory was hoisted up to the top. 
                We each were allowed to climb up and look around from a height 
                of approximately 15 feet! The days were filled with exploring, 
                fishing, and boat rides. In the night we talked by the campfire, 
                performed our skit for Troop 463, enjoyed their skit, and read 
                comic books. We also played Uno, by flashlight, in our tent.<br>

              <p> HIGH ADVENTURE - HAWAII<br>
                Kim</p>
              <p align="left">The High Adventure guys are getting ready to plan 
                their next High Adventure Excursion. This time they will be going 
                to Hawaii! The dates blocked out for this trip are June 22 - July 
                10. The trip will be 14 - 16 days long. We are in the early planning 
                stages and trying to gather all of our ideas to research. So far 
                we know we want to go to Kauai and backpack, scuba dive, snorkel 
                and kayak. Each scout interested in going on the trip is being 
                asked to put forward his ideas. We may add in a visit to the Big 
                Island if there is time. We have our first fundraiser schedule 
                although sign ups have been extremely SLOW (hint. hint..). The 
                first payment will be made in early December. The trip budget 
                will fall between $900.00 and $1200.00, and will be set once all 
                of the ideas have been researched.<br>
                If you are a First Class Scout, an active participant in troop 
                activities, eager to do adventurous activities, willing to be 
                a team player, and have a lot of FUN, you could be a member of 
                this year Adventure Trip.<br>
                For more information, questions AND to RSVP you must call or email 
                Mrs. Thurgate by Nov 27. We will also need 4 adults on this trip 
                - so Adults please think about the trip and talk to me!<br>
                We will have 1 meeting a month and have 2 conditioning trips to 
                get ready. Participation in these activities is required. Your 
                assistance in any fundraisers is also highly encouraged.<br>
                I hope to hear from all of you considering this trip soon. So 
                far I have David Ho, Bryant Look, Brian Thurgate, James Enomoto 
                and Eric Garcia confirmed. The rest of you need to call me! So 
                far we only have Mr. Thurgate confirmed for adults.<br>

              Tim</p>
            <p>What do you want to get out of Scouting? This is the question each 
              of you should ask yourselves. It can be answered many different 
              ways and on many levels. But no matter what the answer or why you 
              are in Scouting, it will not be achieved without good attendance. 
              Below are some reasons it is important to attend the troop meetings.</p>
            <p>1. To prepare for outings. Outings are fun, exciting, and a chance 
              to get away and do something different. But outings do require some 
              preparation &#150; planning, menus, equipment, organizing who is 
              doing what, and so on. You will not know what is going on with the 
              outings or anything else if you miss the announcements and flyers 
              at the troop meetings.<br>
              2. Get acquainted with other members of the troop. Things are more 
              fun with people you know. Troop meetings and outings will be more 
              fun and meaningful if you have connected with other scouts. But 
              this will not happen if you are not there regularly. Conversely, 
              being an outsider is a drag and you will be a stranger if you only 
              show up occasionally.<br>
              3. Learn new skills. One of the goals at troop meetings is to teach 
              the skills needed to safely enjoy the outdoors. However, much of 
              what is learned is useful for much more than just outings. While 
              learning can take effort and be challenging, it can also be very 
              rewarding.<br>
              4. Advance in scouting. Certainly missing the </p>
          </td>
          <td width="49%" valign="top"> 
            <p align="left">learning needed to pass requirements, as well as the 
              opportunities is going to make achieving rank more difficult and 
              take longer. But this also applies to advancing to the leadership 
              of the troop. Clearly, the growth needed to become a leader will 
              happen more slowly or not at all without regular attendance.<br>
              5. Help the troop. I am sure you all want to be part of a great 
              troop with fun and interesting meetings. But how is this going to 
              happen if at any given meeting only half the scouts are there? It 
              takes everyone to make it work.</p>
            <p align="left">The above list applies to outings as well. Many of 
              the skills can only be taught and the corresponding requirements 
              passed on outings. And outings are where many of the others are 
              put into practice and so become meaningful and more fully learned. 
              Besides outings are fun!<br>
              Scouting really asks for very little of your time - less than one 
              and a half hours per week for the troop meeting (most extracurricular 
              activities demand more than that each day), plus an opportunity 
              to get out and have fun once a month. <br>
              The older scouts give much more time. They meet before and after 
              each troop meeting to make final preparations and to discuss what 
              worked and what didn&#146;t and to ensure everyone knows what they 
              need to do for the next meeting. They meet once a month to plan 
              the month&#146;s troop meeting and participate in a leadership outing 
              once a year to plan the next year&#146;s outings. They also spend 
              time at home preparing for the meetings - acquiring materials, organizing 
              the activities, and planning the lessons and presentations. Our 
              troop is fortunate in having senior scouts who are committed to 
              providing a superior scouting program and conscientious in carrying 
              it out. But it is demoralizing when the other scouts do not care 
              enough to show up.<br>
              Below is the attendance record for this year. As can be seen, the 
              senior scouts are there most of the time. Part of the reason for 
              this is by time they have gotten that far, they recognize the importance 
              of attendance. Part of the reason is that scouts that have poor 
              attendance do not get enough out of scouting to stick with it. And 
              part of the reason is the senior scouts rising to the </p>
