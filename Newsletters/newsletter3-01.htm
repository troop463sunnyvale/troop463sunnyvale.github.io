              <p style='text-align:justify;'>Few people will ever experience the joys and tribulations of 
                being the Senior Patrol Leader of Troop 463. It really was quite 
                a unique experience. But, unfortunately, my term of office is 
                up, and there isn&#146;t a moment I do not regret. I can remember 
                when I became SPL, I was so jovial and excited about finally leading 
                the troop. I went home and dreamed and schemed all of my different 
                wonderful plans for the troop, but alas, I was unable to complete 
                all of them. If there&#146;s one thing I have learned from my 
                past term of office, it would be that time is precious.<br>
                Time really is precious, that&#146;s the reality of the matter. 
                Don&#146;t get me wrong, I feel accomplished and successful, but 
                there was still more I could have accomplished. It&#146;s the 
                extra work, the extra mile, and the extra effort that makes something 
                that much better. In the beginning of my term as SPL, everything 
                felt so surreal, so exciting. Yet, as time progressed, I began 
                to understand why being SPL is associated with the terms &#147;difficult&#148; 
                or </p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>&#147;challenging.&#148; I realized 
              that it would be impossible for me to complete everything I had 
              wanted to complete; only this epiphany came too late. For so long, 
              I tried in vain to get things done all at once, to try and go for 
              the quick-fix. In the end, it became quite clear, that change would 
              take time, only longer than I had expected.
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>So, fellow scouters, for those of you 
              who have aspirations of becoming SPL, think seriously about the 
              goals you have for the troop. Understand that time is precious and 
              that lofty goals are good, but think about them realistically. And 
              whenever you think you&#146;re doing something well, strive to do 
              better than that. I&#146;ve seen the best and worst of you.
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>All of you have the potential to be 
              great leaders some day. It&#146;s the drive in every one of you 
              that you have to figure out. Once you&#146;re ready, I encourage 
              you to campaign for the office of SPL.
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Thanks guys for your willingness to 
              work with me. I appreciate your cooperation, and if ever I offended 
              you ... forgive me. Who knows, maybe I&#146;ll run next year! Just 
              kidding guys,.. Oh, and good luck David, trust me, you&#146;ll need 
              it...

              September, 30 - October, 1<br>
              David</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Outing This year&#146;s Sunset Beach 
              outing was a lot different from the last (so I&#146;ve been told; 
              I didn&#146;t go last year), because this time, we missed Coastal 
              Cleanup Day. (See my other article on Coastal Cleanup Day if you&#146;re 
              bored and have nothing better to do.) Last year, the Scouts had 
              to clean up the beach for a service project, but this time, the 
              focus was just on having fun. We did set aside about two hours for 
              advancement, but that&#146;s compared to about nine hours of playing 
              games and free time. I arrived late because I had to go to a soccer 
              game, Before I got there the others had played several volleyball 
              games, football on the beach, had lunch, some younger scouts got 
              several requirements signed off during advancement, and the discovery 
              of a dead seal on the beach ... After we ate dinner, we had a bunch 
              of free time, so we mostly played cards and stuff. When it got somewhat 
              dark, we played capture the flag, which was fun, and then we went 
              down to the beach to look at the stars through binoculars; the adults 
              pointed out several constellations to look for.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The next day, after eating breakfast 
              and cleaning up camp, doing that police line thing we always do, 
              we went to the beach again. Half of us played volleyball, and the 
              other half went and dug a hole for no apparent reason at all (I 
              think some scouts wanted to bury the dead seal, some wanted to fill 
              it with water, and some other scouts wanted to bury the other scouts 
              ... ). I played volleyball- it was kids vs. adults, and I think 
              we won some of the games and the adults won some of the games. (I 
              forgot, because this article was written on January 1, 2001, so 
              I can&#146;t remember all of the details - that&#146;s what I get 
              for procrastinating.)<br>

              Bryant</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>We arrived at the church early in the morning, so 
              we could reach our destination early. Everyone was anxious on the 
              car ride-up there, and when we reached there around 10 in the morning, 
              they were relieved and tired. We loaded the luggage onto a barge/boat, 
              on which some of the scouts and Webelos traveled in. The rest of 
              us took the short walk up to camp. There we had a delicious breakfast 
              of bagels with various toppings available, and some of the Webelos 
              and scouts took to toasting them over a smoldering fire.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>We started our lashing projects around noon, with 
              most of the scouts and Webelos working on what would be a 10-foot 
              tall tower from which you could get a good lookout point, while 
              a few other scouts and Webelos worked on the camp flagpole. Everyone 
              worked hard, and after a couple of hours, hands had rope and wood 
              splinters and rope burns, but the projects were done. Everyone climbed 
              up on the tower, gazing from the awesome view high atop the ground. 
              Then we sat down to a deserving lunch of sandwiches, chips, and 
              Kool-Aid.</p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>In the afternoon, the honor patrol 
              got these interesting little toys, which involved a container with 
              a water balloon traveling quickly between string that the players 
              held. The string was tied to handles, so when the container hit 
              one side, the balloon exploded. After that wild fun which got almost 
              everyone wet, some of us stayed at camp while others went for a 
              tour of the lake on the barge/boat. Several interesting things happened 
              on the boat, including a swamping of the boat, which led to a pair 
              of sandals being carried into the lake, and a scout who wishes not 
              to be named who drove the boat/barge like a maniac, zigzagging across 
              the take and trying to go into a spot of the lake small enough for 
              only kayaks and canoes.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The scouts and Webelos were pretty 
              tired after that, but some of us got together for a friendly game 
              of football. Later we had dinner before retiring to bed. The next 
              morning, they disassembled the projects, put away the poles and 
              ropes, loaded their gear into the boat, then did a final trash inspection 
              before traveling back to the cars, which lead them home.</p>

              November 10-12, 2000<br>
              Brian</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The November outing was a backpacking trip to camp 
              Ohlone. The size of the group who went was very disappointing, consisting 
              of only five people two of which were adults. The scouts who went 
              were James, Karl, and Myself. We left the church at about seven, 
              for our drive to the parking lot. The parking lot is the same one 
              used to go to Mission peak, and although we could have driven all 
              the way in to camp Ohlone, we decided to backpack the four and a 
              half miles in.</p>
            </td>
          <td> 
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>After arriving at camp at about one, 
              we had lunch, and then just messed around until dinner. While cooking 
              dinner we lit the fire, which we had prepared earlier, it was a 
              basic log cabin shape, and about four feet high. The wood was a 
              little wet, but after getting a small amount of leaves to burn we 
              were able to keep throwing leaves on the fire until it got fairly 
              high, then all of the wood started at the same time creating a blaze 
              which reached the tree above it. It didn&#146;t start the tree on 
              fire, but it turned a lot of leaves black.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>On the second day of our hike we decided 
              to go for a day hike, and followed a road that went to the top of 
              one of the hills, which ran next to the valley. We were about half 
              way up when we came across a gate, which barred our way. Karl wanted 
              to go back because he was getting tired so him and his dad returned 
              to camp, while my dad, James, and I continued hiking. After a few 
              miles we stopped and had lunch then continued our trek to the top 
              of the hill. We reached what was the highest point for miles, and 
              after looking around, seeing some deer, and having a snack we started 
              back.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>We hadn&#146;t gone far when we saw 
              a rock outcropping which we decided to climb we didn&#146;t see 
              much from the top and continued on our way, and in about a half 
              of an hour a guy came down the road in a red Chevrolet pickup, with 
              a white shell. We stepped aside to let him pass, and discovered 
              that he wanted to talk. He was not very nice and wanted to know 
              why we were on his property. We explained that we were just hiking, 
              and after a bit of talking he got back in his pick-up, and drove 
              slowly away, obviously going slow to keep an eye on us. An hour 
              or so later we passed the gate where Karl had turned around, and 
              a few minutes later the guy passed us again, and talked to us this 
              time however he was a little nicer. After a small chat we continued 
              on our way and soon were back in camp. We didn&#146;t do anything 
              real special, aside from lighting some gunpowder, which we had gotten 
              out of a bullet that we found near a second gate. It was very neat 
              when we lit it because it burned surprisingly slowly.<br>
              After a good night sleep and some breakfast we hiked back to the 
              cars, and drove back home. It was a very fun filled and exciting 
              weekend.</p>

                not really we but we did have a simulated trip. In the simulation 
                we did run into some problems like the radiation leak or the water 
                ph problem. Although all of these problem were simulated here 
                were some real problems like equipment not working for the cameras 
                or how the speakers did not work at first. At the space center 
                we watched a presentation in the planetarium about when Jesus 
                was born Our other big thing on our agenda was the Imax theater 
                were they were showing a movie on the sun. Between the two most 
                of the people got neck aches if they sat in the wrong place.</p>

                outing to Mount Madonna located in the Santa Cruz Mountains. We 
                did some interesting things. For one of our activities, the entire 
                troop was to clear and widen the trails under the guidance of 
                a ranger. The ranger commented that it would have taken him much 
                longer to do the same job instead of the one day it took us. The 
                highlight of this outing was getting the opportunity </p>

              were able to shoot at ranging in difficulty level, some were easier 
              than others. Some of the targets we shot at were very far way and 
              located across a dried up river bed or between a lot of trees. Of 
              course, many of the scouts broke or lost their arrows. This was 
              probably one or the best and most enjoyable outing our troop has

              February 10<br>
              Anthony</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Ahhh, W.E.S.T. Those letters never held so much depth, 
              so much meaning. Actually, I really have no idea what W.E.S.T stands 
              for, but I have a pretty good idea some of our new scouts do, and 
              the few that will be joining us shortly. Yep, that&#146;s right, 
              new scouts! On February tenth, nearly all cub scouts in the Polaris 
              District went searching for the troop that they felt worthy of their 
              presence after they received their Arrow of Light. So, we decided 
              to show what we were made of, and flexed our scouting skills. For 
              those of you who didn&#146;t come, or really didn&#146;t hear about 
              it, Troop 463 constructed a monkey bridge, displayed some photographs 
              of past activities, and of course, refreshments. Despite foul weather, 
              hearty little cub scouts still made their way out to the various 
              troops and according to one Cub Scout parent, &#147;were well fed.&#148; 
              As a result of our hard work, Troop 463 acquired three new scouts 
              and will be seeing more soon enough. All-in-all, W.E.S.T. was a 
              huge success (even though I still don&#146;t know what the letters

              <p style='text-align:justify;'>On Saturday March 10th we went on a hike to the 
                top of Mission Peak. We would have gone on the hike on the fourth 
                of March, but it was raining and blowing. Waiting a week we were 
                rewarded with great weather. We left for the hike at 8:00 am and 
                returned around 3:00 pm. The hike was a strenuous one and many 
                people where huffing and puffing by the top. The hike was over 
                six miles total and we climbed almost 2000 feet to the summit 
                elevation of 2517 feet. The grade of the trail was as much as 
                30 degrees at times. At the top of the mountain we had a great 
                view of the valley below while we ate lunch. This trail is one 
                of the trails in the Rim of the Bay patch. The patch is made up 
                of a main round patch and then six segments that go around the 
                patch that represent the hikes. After having done Mission Peak 
                there are 5 other trails that we need to do to complete the patch. 
                The next trail that we are doing is the trail up Mount Wittenberg,

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>For my Star community service project, I went along 
              with several other students at Bellarmine to St. Francis Beach in 
              Half Moon Bay for Coastal Cleanup Day, September 16. Our school 
              requires that everyone do 25 hours of service for graduation each 
              year, so getting hours for Star was easy(ish). As part of the Community 
              Service Program Core group, we organized this project with girls 
              from Castelleja High School; there were about 30 people in all. 
              We were supposed to arrive at about 10:30, but because of delays 
              trying to find a couple of students (who never showed up), we arrived 
              somewhat late. When we got there, some people handed out latex gloves 
              and two bags for each person: one for trash and one for recyclables. 
              One person also got a checklist to note down all the stuff we got.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Because we arrived late, we found that earlier beach 
              cleaners had almost swept the beach clean so there was much less 
              to clean than we expected. Therefore, we had to look through streams, 
              trails, and other places where other people did not look to find 
              trash. Some of the things we found, besides the obvious cigarette 
              butt, soda can, or candy wrapper, were: old credit cards, fragments 
              of towels, old rusty pieces of metal (it looked like it was from 
              a carriage), and a pile of bones (hopefully not human). Ironically, 
              we did find a </p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>One Saturday morning in December, I 
              went to my church at around 10 AM in the morning. They had passed 
              out bags with a flyer attached the week before, explaining they 
              would be collecting food for the homeless and would come next Saturday 
              to pick up the bags.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>We got organized in our groups, got 
              our maps of the streets each group was assigned to, then we headed 
              out. It took us a while to find the street, but we finally arrived 
              and we hopped out of the van. We checked each house, seeing if it 
              had a bag and flyer on its porch. We went through &#145;many houses, 
              big and small, of all different colors and sizes. Some people had 
              only a few things to give, while others had huge bags filled to 
              the top. Most of it was normal, but some of the things in the bags 
              seemed like the people were just trying to get rid of things they 
              didn&#146;t want. One example is a bag with several huge cans of 
              Mexican beans and a real pumpkin. (Halloween decorations?)<br>
              We finished our assigned streets in about two hours, and we headed 
              back to the church to bring our bags in. We had about twenty some 
              packed into the van, and we unloaded them inside the church. About 
              twenty minutes later, after everyone had come in, we loaded the 
              bags into the cars that would take the bags to where Cityteam was 
              located. (Cityteam was the organization that was distributing the 
              bags) We watched the cars go, then we went home.</p>

              Tim</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>I would like to welcome our new scouts. 
              I hope you will find Boy Scouts and being in our troop both rewarding 
              and fun. You are making a big transition in going from Cub Scouts 
              to Boy Scouts and I thought I would take this opportunity to explain 
              a little of what Boy Scouts is about.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Obviously, there is much about Boy 
              Scouts that is similar to Cub Scouts and hopefully you will quickly 
              feel at home. There are however, some important differences. You&#146;ll 
              notice that the troop is run by the boys and not the adults. You 
              will also find that you will have to do much more yourselves and 
              that getting requirements signed off and earning rank is up to you. 
              It will not happen unless you make it happen.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Boy Scouts attempts to help boys in 
              the bigger transition of becoming adults. Its goal is to develop 
              character and create good citizens. To make this process fun, the 
              program is centered on the outdoors. Just as in Cub Scouts, there 
              are ranks to be earned by passing sets of requirements. The requirements 
              for the first three ranks, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class, 
              are for the most part skills and knowledge that are needed to safely 
              enjoy the outdoors - pitching a tent, cooking, map and compass, 
              first aid, knots, lashing, etc. I want to emphasize that the real 
              work of Boy Scouts is not in acquiring the skills themselves, but 
              in the character building that occurs in the process of learning 
              the skills. The scout learns initiative, self reliance, and responsibility. 
              This does not mean that we are not serious about the skills. They 
              are useful to know in and of themselves and</p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;'>we want the scouts to be do their best, 
              not learn how to get by on minimal effort. Ideally, the rank is 
              a symbol that the scout has acquired certain skills, but in practice, 
              it provides the motivation for learning the skills.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>After earning First Class things change 
              somewhat. For the upper three ranks, Star, Life, and Eagle, merit 
              badges are earned to learn the skills. Each merit has its own set 
              of requirements, allowing the topic to be learned in much greater 
              depth. While certain merit badges are required, the scout has large 
              variety to choose from to suite his interests. In addition, the 
              scout also has to perform community service and serve in a leadership 
              position. He now helps run the troop - plans the meetings, chooses 
              the outings, teaches and guides the younger scouts. This is the 
              heart of scouting. The saying the best way to learn is to teach 
              applies to much more than just the skills that are being taught. 
              By being responsible for seeing that the troop functions properly, 
              the scout learns the importance of planning, preparation, respect, 
              discipline, and so on.<br>
              I think the transition to leadership is actually more difficult 
              for the boy than the transition from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts. The 
              transition to Boy Scouts is the more difficult one for the parents. 
              Things are not as organized as when adults ran the pack. And the 
              parent often doesn&#146;t know what is going on since information 
              goes directly to the scouts and mostly stops right there. For the 
              boy, there is the big unknown and corresponding anxiety of going 
              someplace new, but once he is there, it isn&#146;t all that different 
              from what he was doing in Cub Scouts. Of course, being away from 
              home on the first couple of outings can be difficult, especially 
              if it&#146;s the first time. But hopefully he&#146;s having so much 
              fun and the older scouts are helping him through this transition 
              (right guys?!) that its no big deal.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Changing roles from one of the guys 
              to being a leader is not easy. Almost no one, including the scout 
              himself, recognizes his role as a leader. The current leaders, who 
              have been trying to get him to pay attention and stop goofing off, 
              are not about to delegate any authority to him. And certainly his 
              peers and even younger scouts do not feel they need to do what he 
              says. And yet he has been given the responsibility to carry out 
              some task and is being prodded by his scoutmaster to get it done. 
              This is a slow transition, but </p>

              Kim</p>
            <p align="center">SECOND THURSDAY OF EVERY MONTH at 7:30.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Just a reminder to ALL of the parents, 
              you are an important member of the Troop Committee and we encourage 
              at least one or both parents from each family to participate at 
              the meetings. Here you get to learn first hand what is happening 
              in the troop and not have to depend on your son to keep you informed. 
              The Committee Meeting is also a place for us parents to come together 
              to get better acquainted and work together to make this an enjoyable 
              experience for our sons. The best reason that I can think of for 
              you to come though, is that by coming to the meeting you will have 
              the opportunity to give your views about how the troop should run. 
              It is a great place to learn more about why things happen as they 
              do or to encourage a change in how you feel things should run. Also, 
              history shows that the boys do better in the scouting program when 
              their parents are active in the program too. As families become 
              better acquainted, we each feel more responsible for the success 
              of each other&#146;s sons. The Committee Meeting handles the business 
              of the troop but does not have to be all work, we&#146;d like the 
              meetings to be FUN too. We encourage your creative suggestions and 
              ideas. </p>

              May 19th 10:00 - 5:00</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>If you haven&#146;t heard about signing up for this 
              event, talk to your son! Information was sent out at the April 24th 
              meeting. This event falls during the weekend of Camporee - so that 
              means it will be an ADULT run event!! The shifts are: 9:00 &#150;1:30 
              and 1:00 &#150;5:30. CALL Me Now to sign up. Kim Our troop sells 
              ice cream at the Hands on the Art Festival held at the Sunnyvale 
              Community Center and we have traditionally done very well. We need 
              you to sign up! Last year this was a High Adventure Fund Raiser 
              but since that group will not be having a major trip this year, 
              like Alaska, it will be open to all families interested in putting 
              a few extra $s into their son&#146;s account. It is a very easy 
              event to work and a lot of fun! We will also need to easy to pull 
              wagons. Older siblings can help too if they want.</p>

            <p>Mark your calendar now. June 2 is the Sunnyvale Art and Wine Festival. 
              This is the troops largest fund-raiser. We will need every body 
              to help out on this event, so be sure to save this date. Sign ups

              Scrip Program</p>
            <p>Troop 463 is now registered with E-scrip! The sign up forms are 
              attached.</p>
            <p align="center">How does e-scrip work?</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>To begin earning money through e-scrip, you will need to complete 
              the attached form and register your various cards. Send the form 
              plus $10.00 to the address on the form. For every card you register 
              with e-scrip and use at the designated merchants, the troop will 
              receive a percentage of the purchase total. The troop will receive 
              a statement to show how much was earned for your son and that amount 
              will become available for your son to use towards summer camp or 
              a high adventure activity. You can not get cash back, the money 
              stays in the account for your son&#146;s activities. Should your 
              son leave the troop, his personal account will be transferred into 
              the troops general fund. You can increase your earnings by asking 
              relatives and friends to register with e-scrip under the troops 
              Group ID # and your son&#146;s name. If you prefer to register on-line 
              or need more information you can check their web site at www.escrip.com 
              - be sure to include the Group ID # when you register on-line.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>If you are already a participating member of e-scrip through another 
              organization, you can use the same form to add the troop to your 
              account for $5.00. E-scrip allows you to register up to 3 different 
              organizations. They will divide your earnings between each organization 
              and send each one a monthly statement.</p>

            Albertson&#146;s Market. They will be sending us special cards to 
            use when we shop Albertson&#146;s and again a percentage will be sent 
            to the troop. The percentage varies depending on the troops total 
            purchases. We will talk more about this program at one of the Committee 
            Meetings.

            <p align="center">High Adventure Program</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>The High Adventure Program is for boys 14 - 17 and with the rank 
              of First Class and above. It is an additional program to supplement 
              the already exciting troop activities. The program offers more challenging 
              outdoor activities and new opportunities. Since our group is small, 
              we will begin inviting neighboring Troops and Crews to join us to 
              enhance the enjoyment for everyone. We will also be notifying you 
              of any events they are doing in which we may join them</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>Our last activity was Cross-Country Skiing and Snow Camping but 
              due to the lack of available adults, the trip needed to be canceled. 
              Some people went anyway with buddies and were able to work towards 
              the Snow Sports merit badge and earn the Venture Patrol pins.</p>
            <p style='text-align:justify;'>We had hopes of getting a few qualified scouts together for a day 
              of diving but that may not happen this year due to busy schedules 
              and not enough people to cover the cost of the Master Diver. We 
              will try again next year. So if Scuba Diving interest you, please 
              check out your local dive shop for classes. Give me a call if you 
              need more information. You can get certified as young as 12 but 
              Boy Scouts require the boys to be 14 prior to diving with the troop. 
              Youth must also dive with </p>

            In August we are trying to put on a 50 mile Sierra Trek. There will 
            be some conditioning trips needed to qualify, so please be sure to 
            let Mr.or Mrs. Thurgate know of your interest so that you are notified 
            about meetings and prep trips. We need to hear from you and find out 
            when your school will start back up so that we can firm up the date. 
            This trip is also looking pretty shaky due to the low interest and 
            busy calendars.<br>
            The success of the High Adventure program depends greatly on the participation 
            of the older scouts and interested adults. The interest has been low 
            this year and we hope that by inviting other troops to join us, we 
            will be able to keep this program alive. What activities interest 
            you? How can we get you involved in the Venture Patrol? Your input 
            is important!!
