      <p> Another Court of Honor is coming up, and you know what that means- another 
        patrol status report from me. Well, I&#146;m happy to report that our 
        patrol finally got a flag, thanks to the hard work put in by Tenderfoot 
        Scout Todd. Our patrol has been busy over the past few months, getting 
        requirements signed off and learning new skills. Chris Davis earned the 
        Tenderfoot rank after working hard for several months at it. The Sharks 
        worked hard in January and we earned the most honor patrol points, so 
        we avoided getting the Cleanup Patrol duty at Mount Madonna. I hope everyone 
        got some rest over the Winter Break, since there&#146;ll be a lot of things 
        coming up: the Court of Honor, the Ski Trip, and the all-important Camporee. 
        So keep working hard, summer is only a few months away!</p>

      <p>Since the last Court of Honor, our troop has been on many fun outings. 
        Some of our more popular outings have been to Mt. Madonna Park and the 
        overnight trip on the USS Hornet. I hope that all of the scouts who went 
        on these outings, or any of the others, had a lot of fun and will be at 
        the other outings that we have planned. If anybody has any suggestions, 
        within reason, for an outing they might want to have, please tell the 
        senior scouts and we will do our best to get it organized at our next 
        J.L.T. On these outings, you have the opportunity to use the skills you 
        have learned, get requirements for your ranks signed off, AND have fun. 
        During my time as the SPL of this troop, the senior patrol and I have 
        tried to help you scouts with your requirements to the best of our abilities. 
        In order for us to do this, we need you to come to us for requirement 
        signoffs and ask any questions you might have, but at the right time! 
        We try to schedule time during most meetings for this&#133; so please 
        plan ahead!! It is very important for all of you to try and advance to 
        the next rank. In March, we are expecting many new scouts to join our 
        troop and they will be working hard on advancing. It will greatly help 
        if they had all of us to answer any question that they might have and 
        assist them with their requirements. Finally, please remind your parents 
        that our troop has a parent Troop Committee Meeting every second Thursday 
        of each month and their presence is requested. Many important items are 
        discussed (both present and future), and this is a good time for them 
        to share their opinions.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year we went on an outing and we invited the webelos from 
        nearby packs to join us. We do this every year as a way to bring more 
        webelos into our troop, when they graduate to Boy Scouts. Our trip went 
        to Del Valle, where we camped out next to the lake. We had about fifteen 
        webelos come on the trip. The trip lasted from Saturday to Sunday afternoon. 
        We did several activities, including building a tower and going out on 
        the lake with boats. Granted the tower was crooked and we almost sank 
        the boat, but that was most of the fun. The webelos had lots of fun playing 
        in a stand of cattails near where we were camping. Later that evening, 
        we played capture the flag in the cattails.&nbsp; We had a lot of fun, 
        especially because we didn&#146;t have to cook. This is one of the very 
        few outings in which the adults do all the cooking. This outing is one 
        of the most fun we have all year and we hope that the webelos had lots 
        of fun as well. This is an outing that we&#146;ll be doing for many years 
        to come, because it has become such a success and it is a great way to 
        show people our troop.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Pescadero Creek<br>
          11/9-11/02<br>
          James</p>
        <p align="left">In November, our troop took a short backpacking trip to 
          Pescadero Creek. We stayed there for 3 days and, for the most part had 
          a lot of fun. The first day we hiked in and set up camp. When we got 
          there, we noticed that there was no clean water for us to use. We found 
          that the only clean water was down at the creek at the bottom of a hill. 
          Every time we needed water we had to walk down to the creek, fill up 
          a container and take the long trail back up to camp.<br>
          The next day we had a slow start and left camp at about 11:00 a.m. When 
          we finally left, we went on a hike up to the top of the mountain. Unfortunately 
          for us, near the beginning of the hike it started to rain. For most 
          of the hike we were hiking up a muddy trail to get to our destination, 
          a rest house at the top. When we got there, everyone was happy that 
          we were finally able to eat lunch and take a break. After lunch we started 
          our hike back down to our campsite. During our descent we were lucky 
          that we didn&#146;t encounter any more rain. After that hike, many of 
          us were looking forward to a nice dinner. Unfortunately, before we were 
          able to eat our dinner, there was an accident causing us to lose our 
          meal and we went to sleep on an empty stomach.<br>
          Before we left, once again not all that early, we had more trouble with 
          our meal. Since we didn&#146;t get off to an early start, and many of 
          us wanted to go home, we decided to skip breakfast and just start our 
          hike out. All things considered, I believe that all of the scouts who 
          went on this trip, enjoyed themselves and had a fun time. For all of 
          the scouts who did not go on this outing, I hope that you will go on 
          our next backpack trip in the spring. It will be a lot of fun. </p>

          Brian</p>
        <p align="left">The December outing was an overnight trip to the USS Hornet. 
          We went over in two different groups, the first, leaving at twelve, 
          took the aviation merit badge, and those who went and actually tried, 
          got the merit badge. The second group got to the Hornet around six and 
          immediately started learning about the rules and the Hornet. Soon after 
          the second group arrived, everyone except me joined the first group 
          to learn about the Hornet. I was busy taking a tour of the cockpit of 
          an F-14, which was a very interesting, neat, and educational tour, essentially 
          consisting of the pilot and radar operator pointing out what the different 
          buttons, gauges, fuses, and levers did. After finishing my tour, I joined 
          the rest of the troop and we were soon escorted to our sleeping quarters, 
          a room about half the size of the church, where all twenty of us would 
          sleep. After dropping off our stuff, we went up on deck and were informed 
          about the plan for the rest of the day. We then went and had dinner 
          and then started touring the ship in earnest. The group I was in started 
          off by learning about the catapults, huge things which, when released, 
          zipped a few hundred feet in a few seconds. We then went and visited 
          the special weapons room, where, when active, the nuclear weapons and 
          support crew stayed. It was nearly totally stripped of all of its stuff, 
          including unfortunately the nukes, but it was very interesting hearing 
          about it and the guide was very funny. After touring the special weapons 
          room, we went to the boiler room, which, according to the guy there, 
          reached temperatures of over 130&deg;. Although it was neat looking 
          at the huge engines, the person talking about it was very un-educational 
          and the </p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>time spent there, most of us feel, was a 
        waste. We then went to a slide show on anti-submarine warfare, or so we 
        thought before we went. Although it was interesting, it wasn&#146;t on 
        anti-submarine warfare. The guy spent about a minute talking about it, 
        then went on to talk about the development of the Russian nuclear submarine, 
        and how he could tell them apart by their silhouette. After the submarine 
        speech we all went down to hear &#147;scary&#148; ghost stories. Everyone 
        had said that they were going to be so scary, getting my expectations 
        up. However, they weren&#146;t at all scary, at least to me. After the 
        ghost stories we went back to our bunks and soon were all asleep (they 
        wouldn&#146;t let us play cardsL).<br>
        The following day we packed up and took all of our stuff to the cars. 
        The people with smaller attention spans went home, while the rest of us 
        explored the ship more. I went and saw the island and command information 
        center, both were fairly interesting although I must say that the CIC 
        was by far the best part of the trip. It was lit only by the radar and 
        tactical information screens and was very cool just to be in. There were 
        also a couple of sonar-buoys, one of which was Russian (don&#146;t ask 
        me how it came to be on the Hornet, I&#146;m sure the Russians didn&#146;t 
        just give it to the Hornet; I think the guy said they got it on e-bay, 
        so I&#146;m thinking maybe I might buy myself a Russian attack sub; now 
        that would be funJ). Anyway back to the Hornet. There was also a picture 
        down in the control room (and in the island) of after the Hornet went 
        through a storm to avoid an encounter with the Japanese in World War II. 
        A couple waves that were a hundred or so feet tall washed over the task-group, 
        and a couple destroyers capsized, a cruiser got one of its 8-inch gun&#146;s 
        knocked off, another aircraft carrier got its flight deck totally rolled 
        up, and the Hornet, the biggest ship in the group, got nearly the entire 
        front half of the flight deck (a deck 60 ft from the surface) broken at 
        an insanely haphazardous angle. It was amazing to see what the ocean could 
        do. After touring the ship for a little longer we all went back home, 
        where we got to feel the comfort of a real bed.</p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;' align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p> This year&#146;s Mt. Madonna outing was pretty amazing. First of all, 
        it didn&#146;t rain for the first time in the history of Troop 463 Mt. 
        Madonna outings (although it was a bit chilly at times). We arrived there 
        somewhere around 8:00 Saturday (I think), spent a while choosing sites 
        and setting up tents, and then embarked on our first adventure: a simple 
        hike. &#133; Led by younger scouts. We spent the entire morning wandering 
        around lost in the wilderness, waiting for the search team to arrive, 
        and in the meantime trying to survive on the snacks we brought along&#133; 
        No, actually it wasn&#146;t that bad. We did take the wrong path several 
        times, and clearly the map-and-compass skills left something to be desired, 
        but in the end, the younger scouts found their way working together as 
        a group. I think they probably learned a bit more independence, responsibility, 
        and teamwork from the experience, in addition to refreshing their navigation 
        skills and putting them to practical use, so the exercise was useful. 
        On the other hand, they took such an amazingly, ludicrously, unbelievably 
        long time (well, maybe that&#146;s a bit of an exaggeration, but you get 
        the point) to figure it out that the senior patrol took over to get back 
        to camp, where we ate lunch. <br>
        Then, we went out for the day for the main attraction: about 3 &#150; 
        4 hours of archery, starting at a single large first target, and splitting 
        into groups to go around the course. This was obviously endless fun, and 
        each group came back with many stories (and many lost arrows). For example, 
        Daniel and Brian almost shot two deer! They had arrows nocked and strings 
        pulled back, ready to release, when, out of nowhere, two deer </p>

        standing very far from the target! And the deer walked across so calmly 
        and matter-of-factly, like &#147;Hello! I&#146;m here for my afternoon 
        suicide appointment. How are you today?&#148;. Anyway, other anecdotes 
        included arrows found (David found a big, expensive, fat aluminum arrow), 
        arrows blunted (David completely flattened the metal tip of an arrow by 
        accidentally hitting a metal bar above a target), arrows exploded (somehow 
        James apparently made an arrow shatter in midair), and trees abused in 
        every way by incoming arrows.<br>
        That night, we had dinner and cleaned up. However, it wasn&#146;t that 
        simple; it took forever to accomplish both tasks, and one patrol had insufficient 
        food. After that, we &#150; and by &#145;we&#146; I mean other people 
        and not me &#150; had even more endless fun hiding AJ&#146;s chocolate, 
        passing it off, running away, and restealing it after he found it.<br>
        Finally, the next day, before leaving, we went out to do a quick service 
        project: one group took out two clumps of pampas grass, a non-native, 
        fast-growing plant that was taking over some parts of the park that it 
        shouldn&#146;t have been. The other group took out another type of plant 
        (I forgot what it was) that also didn&#146;t belong in the park, and also 
        spread incredibly quickly.<br>
        Thus, overall, the outing was extremely fun. Did I mention it didn&#146;t 
        rain?</p>

        Tim Thurgate</p>
      <p>This Court of Honor will be very short, as there is only one scout advancing 
        in rank and three receiving merit badges. Unfortunately, this is typical 
        of our recent Court of Honors, which means our scouts are not advancing 
        at a reasonable pace. In general, it should take no more than a year to 
        achieve the next rank. This is especially true of the lower ranks. As 
        you move up in ranks, they become more difficult so it becomes understandable 
        that Life may take a little more than a year and certainly Eagle will 
        take longer. But, we have many scouts still working on Tenderfoot. It 
        will be embarrassing when we get a new batch of scouts and they earn Tenderfoot 
        before our existing scouts.<br>
        Scouting has many purposes. Certainly, one of our goals is to have fun, 
        go on neat outings, and enjoy the outdoors. Scouting is more than this 
        however. In fact it has to be to fully enjoy the outings. For only if 
        you can take care of yourself and can be self-sufficient are you going 
        to be comfortable and safe in the outdoors. You need to know how to cook 
        to eat well, the proper clothing and how and where to pitch a tent to 
        stay warm and dry, how to keep from getting lost or what to do if you 
        are lost, first aid in case something happens, etc. One of the goals in 
        scouting is to learn these and other skills. If learning and growing is 
        not part of your purpose for being in scouting, then not only are you

        Scouting has an even greater purpose than learning various outdoor skills. 
        It is to help you grow as a person, in character, citizenship, and leadership. 
        This starts when you join scouting. In earning rank you develop initiative, 
        perseverance, respect, and so on. But, this really begins in earnest after 
        you achieve First Class and join in the leadership of the troop. This 
        of course, won&#146;t happen if you do not get to First Class. In fact, 
        shirking the responsibility of learning and of earning rank is actually 
        reinforcing negative character traits. One can tell a lot about a scout 
        by the progress he is making on rank.<br>
        So, stop being lazy, stop resisting learning new skills, stop being an 
        obstacle in the meetings. Get focused, get to work, and come to meetings 
        with a positive attitude and an eagerness to participate. It is work to 
        learn new things and you will struggle at times, but I guarantee that 
        you will have more fun if you go along with the program than in fighting 
        it and you will be a better person for it. You will also get the support 
        of the older scouts and the rest of the troop, instead of having them 
        on your back. We do skills instruction almost every meeting and on the 
        outings. We allow time in the patrol meetings and again on the outings 
        to allow you to get things signed off. If there is more we can do to assist 
        you in earning rank, let us know.</p>
