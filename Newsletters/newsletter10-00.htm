        New (Old) Troop Organization<br>
        Tim </div>
      <p>We have created a new organization for the troop. Actually, it is an 
        old way of structuring the troop, but most of the scouts in the troop 
        have not seen it organized this way. About four years ago, the troop adopted 
        the BSA National recommendation to form new scout patrols. This means 
        that the Webelos just entering the troop form a new patrol consisting 
        of only the new scouts. Obviously, the new scouts need some guidance so 
        they are assigned an older scout to help them out. The older scout is 
        called a Troop Guide.</p>
      <p>This system has a number of advantages. It is less intimidating for the 
        scouts just joining the troop if they get to stay together as a group 
        with friends they knew in Cub Scouts. Patrol meetings are more productive 
        when the patrols are arranged by age, because then all the boys are working 
        on the same thing. Thus, it is hoped that advancement happens more rapidly 
        and since the boy is with friends, he will remain in Scouting longer.<br>
      </p>
    </td>
    <td width="50%">However, organizing around the new scout patrol also creates 
      some problems. The scouts tend to identify with the boys in their patrol 
      more so than with the rest of the troop. This is greatly intensified with 
      the new scout patrol system, because one, the boys stay in the same patrol 
      much longer (often with scouts they've been with all through Cub Scouts), 
      and two, it reinforces the natural tendency for the boys to only associate 
      with boys their own age. It also puts all the young scouts together, who 
      have more energy and are less disciplined, making control more difficult. 
      In this environment, an older scout is then taken out of his patrol and 
      put in charge of a patrol of younger scouts. He is viewed as an outsider 
      by the younger patrol and he is not particularly pleased with having to 
      deal with a bunch of younger boys instead of hanging out with his friends. 
      There can then be more conflict than guidance. 
      <p>The splintering into factions and the lack of cohesiveness of the troop 
        as whole tends to get worse with time. For these reasons, we have gone 
        back to the more traditional patrol structure where the patrols have boys 
        of all ages. There are older boys in each patrol who can get things done 
        and teach the </p>

      <p align="left">younger boys. Each patrol has only a few younger scouts 
        and several older scouts making the guidance of the younger scouts much 
        more manageable. The guidance occurs within a patrol so there is less 
        us versus them.</p>
      <p>Another benefit of the traditional system is that the patrols are more 
        nearly equal in skills and abilities so that competitions and games are 
        more fair and exciting. As a result, we have reinstituted the honor patrol, 
        where a &quot;best&quot; patrol is selected over some period of time for 
        honors and prizes. The criteria for determining the honor patrol are attendance, 
        uniform, patrol flag, competitions, spirit, and progress towards rank.</p>
      <p>The scouts at the PLC meeting spent quite a bit of time on the composition 
        of our two patrols. They tried to split old alliances and to make the 
        patrols equal in the number of older scouts and younger scouts. They worked 
        hard to balance the two patrols in skill and ability and avoid personality 
        conflicts within a patrol. I think they have done a very good job and 
        in fact, the troop meetings have run much smoother and everyone seems 
        to be enjoying them more. But, nobody should get too comfortable with 
        this arrangement. Certainly, when we get new scouts in the spring, we 
        will at the very least, rearrange the patrols.<br>

      <p>We hope you will take the time to read the boy's journal from the Alaska 
        Trip. The planning for the trip began last November and included: several 
        planning meetings, 2 backpacking prep trips, a lesson in sea kayaking 
        in Monterey, and a final pack inspection. There were five scouts and five 
        adults on this trip.<br>
        Each day was full of activities, which the boys will share with you. The 
        abundance of daylight made it easy to accomplish all we wanted. The sunset 
        around 12:30 pm and the sky never did get totally dark. By 4:00 am the 
        sky was becoming bright again. It was amazing to experience such long 
        days.<br>
        Wonderful scouting correspondences were made and the hospitality of the 
        Alaska Troops were something that we would be challenged to repay should 
        they ever come to visit us. One Alaska troop hosted an &quot;all you can

        and the scouts were truly a great bunch of people! Of course this is all 
        something that the boys will probably fail to mention in their journals.

        landscape and vast lands of - the Minnesota airport. No, I'm not kidding, 
        and yes, we were at the Minnesota airport. The shuttle that was: supposed 
        to pick us up at around 1:30 PM or so, instead, was an hour and a half 
        late. Because of that, once we arrived at SF airport, we rushed to bag 
        our luggage (in plastic bags, so straps wouldn't get caught or anything) 
        and catch our flight. Once we had our baggage ready and approached the 
        counter, we found out that. Our reserved seats had been given away because 
        their bus was late!<br>
        So we waited at the airport, trying to find another f light to Anchorage 
        on United, but we couldn't find one. That night we ended up in the newly 
        built Hilton hotel, courtesy of United airlines. We woke up early the 
        next morning to shuttle to the airport where we took the flight to Minnesota. 
        We hung around in the airport for a little while, then finally started 
        the flight to Alaska. We arrived there early evening and were greeted 
        at the gate by two huge stuffed bears (They weren't cute or friendly looking,

        <p align="left">The first part of our trip was the lovely backpacking 
          trip. We had selected several different possibilities for trip locations 
          before we left, but Alaska being Alaska, we had to revise our possibilities. 
          After the interesting events at the airport, we had lost a day for the 
          trip and prepping for it. Most of the trails that we had initially planned 
          to go on were still covered with snow<br>
          deep enough to swallow some of our shorter scouts (cough Bryant, cough) 
          whole. So we had to ask around and find a trail that was thawed out. 
          We ended up going to a portion of the ldittarod historic trail that 
          ran 23 miles to the Seward Highway.<br>
          We spent the first night of the trip near Portage glacier. After spending 
          an interesting first night, playing with a horrific population of mosquitoes, 
          we all got our stuff ready as quickly as possible to avoid losing too 
          much blood to the little creatures, then drove over to the trailhead.

          of the people not backpacking went along for a little day hike. The 
          weather was amazing, it was sunny and warm, and the bugs were not quite 
          as thick. We spent the first day going along the side of a beautiful 
          glacier carved valley, with lush vegetation on the slopes leading up 
          to the peaks, which still had spotted patches of snow. This was what 
          we came to see in Alaska. We met several nice people along the trail, 
          who told us the entire stretch was clear of snow. Since we had been 
          scared of all the trails in the state, this was very comforting. The 
          first day's hike gradually worked its way up, though we did stay near 
          the valley floor the entire time. There were many beautiful stream crossings 
          and several amazing waterfalls along the route. For most of the day 
          the sun was shining brightly and the weather was surprisingly warm for 
          Alaska. I was told repeatedly by people along the way that we were lucky 
          to have hit such beautiful weather. We stopped for lunch when the group 
          caught up with me on a small meadow in the middle of the valley with 
          the river rushing nearby. Our plan for the day was to walk to a lake 
          about 9 miles into the trail. We made it to it in the early evening 
          although time didn't matter much since if we wanted to get to camp before 
          dark, we would have had over a month to make it. As we were getting 
          closer to the lake it was getting gradually darker and colder as clouds 
          started to build on the peaks surrounding us. When we made it to the 
          edge of the lake, the valley opened up with huge crags on one side and 
          steep carved slopes of green on the other. It was beautiful view perfect 
          for the cameras.</p>

        layers to avoid the cold. Just as we finished cleaning up, the rain just 
        started to fall, not a very good nights sleep was had by Craig!!!!!<br>
        The next morning we woke up cold again, but the rain had stopped, it had 
        only been a light drizzle, but it wasn't what we wanted to hike in. We 
        packed up camp and headed out on the trail towards the pass. Probably 
        from all of our Sierra training, the pass was very easy. It was very gradual 
        and was very low in elevation, but even with this low elevation there 
        was some snow still left on the trail. The day started out very dark and 
        gloomy and only got worse. We soon moved into a thick and lush forest 
        and it started to rain. I don't know about everyone else, but I really 
        enjoyed the sound of the rain as I walked alone through the forest, there 
        was a definite secluded feeling that is a definite change from many of

        the heart of mosquito country and had to eat through our mosquito nets, 
        not an easy task. We continued on with the rain coming and going through 
        the forest the entire day, with several great views as we approached the 
        lake. When the group got to the lake, we could not find a place to camp. 
        We had done more than a dozen miles, and were all very tired, but the 
        ground was too uneven to stop and make camp. We had to keep walking along 
        for more than a mile before we found an acceptable place to stop. The 
        location was a beautiful little campsite with an amazing view of the lake 
        and a little stream coming in for fresh water. We were only a mile from 
        our destination, making for a nice hike on the next day. In about less 
        than 45 minutes we were out of the forest followed by a friendly local 
        dog the size of a bear.</p>

        The day we went dogsledding was a nice sunny day. We were looking forward 
        to having this experience. First we went into a gift shop to register. 
        Then we went outside to learn about the history of the dog sled races 
        on the Idittarod trail once a year. This race started in 1973.<br>
        While this was happening, we heard an occasional loud wave of barking. 
        This was due to the dog's eagerness to pull the cart whenever people were 
        round. I use the word 'cart' because it was a metal wagon with seats in 
        it. It was large enough to hold six adults and it had wheels because there 
        was no snow.<br>
        When it was our turn, the dogs were all eager to pull us. The dogs were 
        attached to the cart the same way they would be attached to a snow sled. 
        We managed to all squish onto one cart. Our pictures were taken when we 
        were on the cart, then we were off! It was a very bumpy ride. When the 
        dogs ran, they leaned into the turns. When we stopped at the halfway rest 
        point, the dogs were very eager to keep going. On this ride we were going 
        about 10 -15 miles per hour.<br>
        When we were done, we got to see and hold some three-month-old puppies. 
        They were cute and liked attention. Their colors ranged from white to 
        brown to black. After</p>

        since we'd been on it so long. In not too long we were at a small shed

        with Tim, Brian, Craig, and Eric. The rest of us stayed behind and did 
        laundry, had lunch, and did a few other errands. We met the hikers around 
        noon. Then we all spent some time looking around Exit Glacier. We went 
        on a small, but nice hike up to the glacier itself, where we took pictures. 
        It was fun. On the way back to the cars, we got split up, but rejoined 
        each other after a while. <br>
        We then drove all the way to Clam Gulch where we rendezvoused with two 
        other Scout Troops. Here we had dinner made by the Alaska troop. After 
        dinner we set up camp and then we had an award ceremony. Each troop exchanged 
        gifts and we a got some badges, pins, and neckerchief slides shaped either 
        as an igloo or an owl face. We also learned at this ceremony a cool way 
        to create a makeshift stove. You take a 1 1/2 to 2 foot long log. Set 
        it on end, and cut an X about &frac34; the way down with a chain saw or 
        ax. Pour lighter fluid</p>

          to bed, we watched the closest thing to a sunset we could see in Alaska. 
          It was pink and orange at first, then went red and violet. It turned 
          the clouds closest to us the same colors. The sun went behind mountains 
          and seemed to pop back out on the other side, minutes later. Well not

          It was the darkest sky that I ever saw while we were in Alaska. We went

        <p align="left"> We packed up in the morning and left Clam Gulch after 
          a breakfast of Sourdough Pancakes. Some of us didn't like them very 
          much. Maybe it was because they were cooked on the same pan as the fish 
          the night before. We appreciated the hospitality and we ate as politely 
          as possible. But we did convinced the adults to let us get McDonalds 
          when they stopped in Soldotna, On our way we saw about two moose and 
          another nice glacier. We had a long drive to reach the Ferry and just 
          enough time. When we got to Portage, we needed to drive through a train 
          tunnel to get to the town of Whittier to catch the Ferry.<br>

        been open since May so they were still letting people go through for free. 
        We were helping them check that everything was working! The tunnel is 
        a train tunnel most of the time and then converts to a car tunnel during 
        certain hours. So if someone gets the time wrong, you could meet a train 
        in the middle of the tunnel. They have all kind of warning lights and 
        signs to prevent that from happening. When we arrived at the tunnel loading 
        area, we were directed to get into one of six lanes, which were released 
        in turn into the huge, long, tunnel. There were signs everywhere to tell 
        you all of the rules and warnings. Once in the tunnel, it had lights along 
        its roof, but it was still very dim. The walls of the tunnel were jagged 
        on either side of the narrow one-lane road. The Anton Anderson Memorial 
        Tunnel is 13,300' or 2.5 miles. It is the longest rail-highway in North 
        America. When we finally got through this cool tunnel, we went into a 
        parking lot and waited a while for the ferry in Whittier. When we got 
        on the ferry at 1:00 p.m., we ate lunch from our ice chest and watched 
        the beautiful view. We saw ice floating by, birds nesting in the cliff 
        faces, waterfalls running into the ocean, Columbia Glacier along with 
        many other glaciers and sea lions basking on rocks. A big sighting was 
        the whales. We only saw their backs and maybe a fin or two.<br>

        equipment we would need for our trip, which included dry bags, life jacket, 
        and tall rubber boots. We would be using 2 man kayaks for our adventure. 
        Each person had a kayak skirt to keep water out of his kayak. We carted 
        every thing to the dock. The staff loaded the kayaks and gear then we 
        loaded the fishing boat that would ferry us to our starting place. After 
        riding the &quot;ferry&quot; boat to our kayak launch location, we were 
        finally kayaking. We were put onto shore and then we needed to load all 
        of the kayaks with the gear. It took about ten minutes to load everything 
        before we actually started to kayak towards camp. We spent this first

      <p>Fort Point <br>
        Saturday 6/28/2003<br>
        &nbsp;It was a clear and pleasant day in Canada on this fine Saturday 
        morning. Ready for adventure and full of eager anticipation, the three 
        new comers Mr. Webb, Daniel, and myself (Derek) began on our first hike 
        along with the previous adventuring crew of Brian, Mr. Thurgate, Alexander, 
        and Mr. Tan. This fist hike was up to Fort Point, where we new comers 
        encountered our first spectacular view of how Canada&#146;s scenery would 
        amaze us throughout our trip. During our 2.4-mile hike we had come across 
        several bikers who seemed to have trouble biking up some of the rather 
        steeper slopes. I would say over all that the bikers only did get to bike 
        a little over three fifths of the trail. For most of those slopes they 
        encountered, they had to drag their bikes up by hand. (Now if a 21-speed 
        mountain bike couldn&#146;t do some of that trail, that says a lot because 
        this was one of the easer hikes that we had done throughout the second 
        half of the trip. Many of the trails of any substance were fairly steep). 
        When we had reached one of the viewpoints, we were able to look out onto 
        the richest expanse of forest landscape that one would normally only see 
        in a national geographic magazine. It was a stunning vision of a deep 
        green forest melted over the rolling slopes of the foothills of a magnificent 
        snow capped giant. The forest seemed to cascade down from its alpine climate 
        zone into the mouth of the prosperous valley below. We took pictures, 
        drank water, and then </p>

        We explored our next viewpoint taking a few more pictures and eating a 
        light snack. When we decided to leave, we followed a trial that turned 
        out to be some sort of shortcut through the forest. The trial lead into 
        a heavily forested part of the mountainside, and began a very steep and 
        treacherous decent. Many times we would use tree limbs as support so as 
        not to fall down the mountain. For a while, we thought we might have a 
        bit of forest exploration to do, but we soon found the real pathway and 
        followed it to our cars. From there we continued on our trip up to Jasper.</p>
      <p>Practicing Our Rappelling<br>
        Sunday 6/29/03<br>
        &nbsp;On Sunday we awoke where we had set up our camp at an area within 
        fairly close proximity to our canyon guides. The camp ground had turned 
        out to be a horse pasture and during our stay was frequently roamed by 
        these friendly animals. It was a beautiful area full of life and within 
        a short walking distance to a nearby stream. This situation set the stage 
        for the most abundant amount of insects we had set eyes on the entire 
        trip. Our attempt to set up our bug canopy to keep the insects away from 
        the food did not go well. <br>
        It was also at this campsite that we met the two local dogs. On the occasions 
        in which they would grace us with their presence the scouts would play 
        fetch with them and tug of war. On one such occasion, we found that the 
        dogs would even play with sticks larger than themselves. The dogs turned 
        out to be one of the most amusing highlights in our stay. During several 
        of our fetch intervals with the dogs, one of them would try to run away 
        into the forest with the newly acquired toy. However, as you can imagine 
        the dogs never made it far with a stick in its mouth stretching out to 
        either side further than the dogs own body length. Our stay on the ranch 
        was very entertaining and we all enjoyed it very much. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        It was this fine Sunday on which we were scheduled to practice our rappelling 
        capabilities as rock climbers, and prepare us for our canyon adventures. 
        When our guides arrived, we all packed our gear into one 15-passenger 
        van, and then proceeded to cram ourselves in. It wasn&#146;t the most 
        comfortable experience; </p>
    </td>
    <td width="49%" valign="top"> 
      <p align="center">in fact it was so rugged that the people in the back seats 
        were told to wear their helmets. <br>
        When the road ended and the van could go no further, we put on our backpacks 
        and started our hike to the top of a nearby ridge. It was the very ridge 
        that the canyon had cut right through. When we reached the top, we took 
        a short break and then proceeded with our testing. The wind was extremely 
        active during most of our time spent on the ridge. It was so strong in 
        fact that at times we had to shout to each other in order to be heard. 
        <br>
        We were to memorize (if we did not already know) the commands used for 
        proper rappelling safety, and use them at all times. There were three 
        ropes on which each of us used to practice our harnessing technique and 
        rappelling. This was all done on the top of the ridge. Once the instructor 
        was satisfied, the ropes were hoisted over the side of the ridge. The 
        next part of our test was to see how well we handled tense situations. 
        We would each rappel about half way down the rock face of the ridge (only 
        about 15-20 feet down), then practice maneuvering in one of the instructed 
        situations, which we were told might happen to us while under one of the 
        waterfalls. <br>
        Fist we practiced rolling, which is pretty self-explanatory. We practiced 
        hanging, which meant we were to put our feet above us and hang upside 
        down then recover from it and rappel the rest of the way down. We tried 
        kneeling, and sitting against the rock face as well. For our final assent, 
        we were to untie a knot in the rope below us, which required us to maintain 
        a good grip on the rope so we wouldn&#146;t fall, and for some of us it 
        took both hands to undo. <br>
        When our practice was finished, we continued on to the next portion of 
        our canyoning practice. When we came across a stream, we set down our 
        backpacks and changed into our wetsuits. This stream was in fact one of 
        the waterfalls that we would rappel under the following day. Our changing 
        area was only 40 feet from a 400-foot cliff dropping into the canyon to 
        which the river fed. <br>
        When we were all suited up, we headed out to a more suitable drop point 
        into the canyon. As soon as we were on our way up the canyon, we were 
        told the fairly simple procedure by which we would travel: We were to

        we were to help the person behind us. We made our way up the canyon lending 
        a helping hand every once in a while to those whom were less agile. Eventually, 
        we came across a heavily shielded area known as Ogre Canyon. As soon as 
        we turned the corner into the dark alley of solid stone, the wind increased 
        its intensity as if to drive us out. The already cool pools of the canyon 
        were replaced by ice-cold water able to sting us even through our insulating 
        wet suits. After a while, we headed back using the same procedure as before. 
        The canyon was no large challenge, but it was dangerous if you were not 
        careful of your footing. There were many rocks slick with slimy brown 
        algae that had caused quite a few slips along the way. Luckily we were 
        all wearing wet suits that acted as a sort of cushion, and helmets. Several 
        of the deeper pools were subject to dives as we made our way back down 
        to our access point. <br>
        Have you ever heard of someone showering under a Canadian waterfall with 
        only swim trunks to insulate them from the cold? No? Then I have a blood-chilling 
        story to tell. It was close to late afternoon by the time we had begun 
        our hike back down from ridge. Only this time, we took a slightly different 
        rout. Why? It was so the guides could introduce us to the last waterfall 
        we would be rappelling down the next day. The scouts were dared to go 
        under it with only swim trunks on, so we did&#133; You may think that 
        we were foolish, but the truth is that we were just too lazy to change 
        into our wet suits again. The waterfall was a dazzling sight to behold; 
        it was virtually glowing with its white foaming curtains of water flowing 
        down the deep black rock face from which it leaped off of from far above. 
        However, the waterfall was quite dazzling in a very different way when 
        you feel it with your bare flesh. It felt like it was showering needles 
        by the bucketful. But the stinging sensation subsided after the first 
        encounter, for once that moment had passed you couldn&#146;t feel your 
        own skin. One by one we each dived under the waterfall to test our tolerance 
        and have a taste of what we would be going up against. Many would try 
        to stay under as long as they could, but if you were one of those who 
        wore no wet suit you would become numb quickly and then able to last as 
        long as you want or until your body could no longer heat </p>

        to a progressively short amount of time. After we were all chilled to 
        the bone (except those who had worn wet suits), we headed back to the 
        van and back onto the road/muddy trail that eventually lead back to our 
        camp site, where we made dinner, repacked for the next day, and went to 
        bed. </p>
      <p>Canyoning - The Real Thing<br>
        Monday 6/30/03<br>
        We awoke on Monday eager to experience the canyoning for real. The morning 
        pretty much worked the same way as the morning before, only this time 
        we discovered that there would be only 2 guides during the actual adventure. 
        This way we would be able to get though the canyon with fewer delays. 
        In the car ride, we discussed how the group would be split up. At the 
        end, it was decided that the scouts would be allowed to go all together 
        first, and the adults would be in the second group. Little did we know 
        that this course of action would lead us scouts into a 4-hour canyoning 
        expedition. <br>
        The adults were to await our arrival at the bottom of the canyon, while 
        the scouts took the trail up the windswept ridge on that supposedly sunny 
        and warm summer day. As we breathed in the pollution free Canadian air, 
        we changed into the wet suits for which we were extremely grateful. <br>
        Once in the canyon, we began to sense the adventure. The rappel rope was 
        slung though 2 carabineers attached to 2 chains that were solidly bolted 
        three feet into solid rock. The rope was doubled over and both ends were 
        flung over the edge and the first guide would follow it down. Each time 
        the group finished one rappel, the rope was retrieved by pulling at one 
        end and letting the other end snake back through the carabineers, then 
        used for the next rappel. These 12-millimeter ropes were not the lightest 
        thing in the world and were even heavier when soaked; even so, a spare 
        was kept on every expedition, and for a very good reason too (sometimes 
        the guides had told us, the ropes did get stuck). <br>
        Our first rappel began with a 15-foot squeeze down a rock crevice and 
        then a drop into open air, where we dangled and slowly eased the rope 
        through </p>

        <p align="left">our harness. As each scout hit the pool below we wondered 
          what the next cliff would be like. It was a steep slant that then dropped 
          to a vertical and slippery rock face. We used a technique in which we 
          just let our rubber-guarded knees slide down the rock while we sat back 
          in our harnesses. The third rappel was similar, but the fourth had two 
          cliffs to it and a short distance in-between. <br>
          It was at about the middle of our canyoning experience that our sunny 
          day became&#133; not so sunny. In fact to our surprise, the dark clouds 
          that we had seen in the distance turned out to be thunderheads. And 
          that&#146;s when things started to get interesting. Up until now, we 
          would amuse ourselves by annoying one another from time to time. However 
          as the rain set in we decided to speed up the pace and get out of the 
          canyon. When waiting for the other scouts, those who had finished the 
          rappel would huddle under a rock overhang or ledge. The canyon began 
          to grow colder especially as we neared the rappel through our first 
          waterfall. <br>
          The thundering in the canyon was like nothing I had ever heard before. 
          It echoed off the walls and reverberated through every stone. As we 
          neared the base of the canyon the wind began to pick up and blew the 
          mist from the waterfalls right on to us. The guide instructed us to 
          get through the first waterfall as quickly as possible, or else we would 
          quite possibly become a human ice cube. This first waterfall was to 
          be the hardest decent of all. It dropped almost 80 feet in two cliffs, 
          one of which passed directly under the full impact of the largest waterfall. 
          This fall dropped at least 50 feet through mid air before pounding on 
          our heads. As I passed under it, it did not feel as strenuous as was 
          suggested. The water just bounced off my helmet and slid down around 
          me. For a moment all I saw was whiteness and all I felt was pressure 
          but no stinging cold, for my jacket provided an abundance of insulation. 
          As soon as I pulled free I scramble as fast as I could into the large 
          pool of water waiting below. <br>
          The temperature began to drop and a couple of the scouts were getting 
          really cold even through the protection of the wetsuit, hood, gloves, 
          and jacket. This is when we really had to pick up the pace. Then a most 
          undesirable thing happened, at our next waterfall rappel, the rope was 
          caught on something. We tried to free it for</p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>what seemed an hour but had no such luck. 
        We instead headed down the last two cliffs on our spare rope. <br>
        The next rappels went by much more smoothly, especially since we then 
        began to descend into a much more sheltered area. When we reached the 
        bottom, we retrieved the rope and headed back to the adults waiting a 
        little way down the stream. There we found a fire going and a brighter 
        and warming atmosphere waiting, for the sun had begun to come out from 
        behind its blanket of black foreboding thunderheads. We ate lunch and 
        stripped out of our cold wet suits to lay them out on sunny rocks to dry. 
        At that time with only one rope left, the guides decided that the party 
        of adults would attempt the canyoning later that week. <br>
        All in all, the canyoning was a most exciting experience, and if I have 
        the chance to do it again, I wouldn&#146;t hesitate to go. For that&#146;s 
        what High Adventure is all about: trying new things in an as safe and 
        exhilarating approach as possible. </p>

        Celebrating Canada&#146;s National Holiday<br>
        Tuesday 7/01/03<br>
        Tuesday was planed to be a very full day. After packing up camp, we set 
        out to our first destination, Maligne Canyon. We ate a delicious lunch 
        of sandwiches and chips by the river and relaxed in the shade of the small 
        grove of trees. <br>
        We then set off on our hike in Maligne Canyon. It is a beautiful place 
        with fractured and jagged rock walls, and emerald green water flowing 
        smoothly through its rugged gorge. The abundant plant life sprouts up 
        along its crude rock walls, and trees lean across its gaping chasms. The 
        sound of the roaring water flow gives a sense of eternal tranquility. 
        We explored its boundaries, following the paths and bridges, taking pictures 
        and enjoying the scenery.&nbsp;<br>
        When we left Maligne Canyon, we headed to our second destination, Mt. 
        Whistler. Mt. Whistler is named because of its unusually high quantity 
        of Hoary Marmots, which make whistling sounds to communicate. When we 
        got there, we had to wait in line for a while before purchasing our tickets 
        for the tram we would be taking to a platform near the top of the mountain.

        <p align="left">we waited, we played cards. The tram was an astonishingly 
          swift transport. On the way up, we were given a lecture on the local 
          area, including the many lakes that occupied the valley, the two rivers 
          that surged beneath us as we were pulled higher and higher, and lastly 
          a detailed description on the famous mountain range and their historical 
          relevance to the first human explorers. Above all was the description 
          on Mt. Whistler, its inhabitance or Picas, Hoary Marmots, and other 
          such rodents. We were told about how almost all the trees were in fact 
          near the same age even though the top most trees nearest the peak were 
          only about three to five feet tall. The reason being that the altitude 
          and amount of sunlight the trees received gave very short growing seasons 
          and thus these three-foot tall trees were near five hundred years of 
          age. The famous mountain range had also become a memorial sight, for 
          the peaks of many were named after the bravest Canadian soldiers who 
          died in battle during the World Wars.<br>
          When we reached the upper platform, we set off to reach to the top of 
          Mt. Whistler. It was a fairly steep climb with some snow still remaining 
          partially shielded from the summer sun. When we reached the top, we 
          took pictures and Brian used a panoramic feature to take a circle of 
          pictures until he had a picture of the entire horizon. We found a sort 
          of sundial like object, which was able to point out the mountains while 
          you line the object up with the name of each mountain. We explored the 
          top of the mountain and some of the scouts used a cement block to play 
          cards on. However, we had to devise a way to hold them seeing as the 
          top of the mountain was exceptionally windy. On our way back down, we 
          tried to slide down the snow patch but with only slight effectiveness.	
          Our next destination was to watch the fireworks that were set off to 
          celebrate July First as it is Canada&#146;s National Holiday. This spectacular 
          event was conducted over an open green field with only one hundred yards 
          separating the onlookers from where they launched the fireworks. The 
          audience was practically underneath the fireworks. We all sat on a grassy 
          hill slick with water from slow drizzle that was soaking everything. 
          We listened to the sound of the explosions thundering off the mountainsides 
          and echoing down the valleys. It was one of the most spectacular firework 
          displays I have ever scene. <br>

        Early Wed morning we woke up early and drove to Brule to meet Jerry to 
        take the adults to rappel down Ogre canyon waterfalls. Together we hiked 
        to the ridge on top of Ogre Canyon where the adults changed into wetsuits 
        to prepare to go down the canyon. Derek, Daniel, Brian, and I then followed 
        a creek up to its source. Normally the source would spout water 20 ft 
        into the air, but this was not the right season. We went anyway and only 
        took 20 min to get there. The source was a large cavern that fit Brian, 
        Daniel, and I. On the way down, there was an excellent view of the valley. 
        We got back to the ridge and hiked to the bottom of the Ogre Canyon to 
        wait for the adults to appear. We waited a while and when we heard the 
        adults, we lit a fire so they would have something warm. <br>
        After lunch, we bid farewell to Jerry and thanked him for a very enjoyable 
        experience and headed west towards Jasper. We decided to spend the rest 
        of the day sightseeing the various lakes and waterfalls in the area like 
        Cavell Lake which was a lake with chunks of glacier floating around. The 
        other one was Athabasca Falls which was a magnificent sight with its multiple 
        levels of waterfall. The night was spent in Whistler&#146;s campsite.

      <p> Thursday, July 3<br>
        We started off early to leave for the Columbia Icefields. We drove straight 
        to the Visitor&#146;s Center and got there by 9:30am. So we spent half 
        an hour looking around the Center. At 10:00am we met up with the guide 
        and started on our hike of the Athabasca Glacier. </p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>The glacier seemed huge but was relatively 
        small compared to the other glaciers surrounding it. It took us 2 hours 
        to get midway up the glacier where we stopped for lunch. After lunch we 
        carried on for another half hour before we stopped because it was the 
        highest point where it was safe for regular hikers. On the way down, we 
        stopped and looked at several millwells which are holes in the ice caused 
        by meltwater gradually wearing away at the ice to form tunnels to the 
        base of the glacier. We also saw several crevasses some going down to 
        100 feet. <br>
        After leaving the glacier, we traveled to the Youth Hostel in Lake Louise 
        to spend the night. Once there, we showered and went to dinner. We spent 
        the evening relaxing at the exquisite lounge at the hostel before retiring 
        to our dorms. </p>
      <p> Friday, July 4<br>
        We breakfasted at the communal kitchen before setting off to the Kicking 
        Horse river for whitewater rafting. When we got there, we were given wetsuits, 
        bootees, sweatshirts, helmets, and lifejackets. When we had suited up, 
        we boarded the bus that took us to the launch site to begin our expedition 
        down the river. The first half of our trip was class 1 and 2 rapids &#150; 
        that was the boring part. The second half was more exciting being class 
        3 and 4. Along the bank we saw several deer and some squirrels. The river 
        flowed through a few canyons and descended several hundred feet. <br>
        When we arrived back at the base, we were served a lunch of burgers and 
        grilled chicken sandwiches. Immediately after lunch, we left for Banff 
        and spent the night at Two-Jack campsite. </p>
      <p> Saturday July 5<br>
        In the morning, my dad and I left for the airport to return home. The 
        others continued the trip by heading back to Lake Louise after obtaining 
        Derek&#146;s rabies shot at Banff. </p>

      <p>This article is about the third and last week of our trip. As you already 
        know the first week was the Thurgates and the Tans backpacking around 
        in the Rockies. The second week the whole gang was there including the 
        Webbs and me, Daniel Lofgren. That was our week of extreme adventures. 
        Sadly for the third week Alex and Mr. Tan left and it was only me, Derek 
        and Mr. Webb, and Brian, and Mr. Thurgate. The theme for this week was 
        day hikes. Our group toured all over Yoho, Kootenay, Glacier, Mt. Revelstoke, 
        Jasper, and Banff National Parks. We saw many spectacular views and lovely 
        vistas. I will now go over some of the places we visited.</p>
      <p>The plain of six glaciers<br>
        This long but interesting hike was in my opinion the best of the dayhikes. 
        We started at the bottom at Lake Louis and hiked up a short way to a small 
        pond next to a rock formation known as Big Beehive. Once we saw it, the 
        reason for its name became evident. It was a large mound shape reminiscent 
        of a termite mound. It was covered on all sides with hundreds of small 
        depressions that looked like the honeycomb shape of beehives. These bees 
        would have had to be several yards long of course. The entire monolith 
        stood several hundred feet in the air and was quite sheer. </p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>The next leg of our journey took us up past 
        a small lake that was the deepest blue any of us had ever seen and none 
        of us would ever see a body of water that blue for nearly an hour (more 
        on that later). The next stop took us to the first of two teahouses that 
        we would see on our hike. We stopped and shared a large pot of tea. It 
        was very good which we probably should have expected because it was a 
        teahouse after all. All of the chipmunks in the area had been so tamed 
        by the constant presence of the humans that they could be convinced to 
        climb right up onto you for the prize of a nut. <br>
        The next leg of the trip took us to the top of the Big Beehive rock formation. 
        On top there was a small pagoda type wooden covering and a spectacular 
        view. Lake Louis below us was so vividly blue-green that it put the rest 
        of the lakes to shame. It looked like a god-proportioned child had dragged 
        a finger covered with sky blue finger-paints through the bottom of the 
        valley. We ate our lunch on the top of this hill and relaxed and took 
        pictures for about half an hour. We then set off once again.<br>
        This next portion of the hike was the longest and lasted for a little 
        over an hour. This part is also were the hike got its name from. At the 
        end of the hike, we began to see snow in ever increasing amounts. At this 
        point, people began to comment quite a lot about the state of Mr. Thurgate&#146;s 
        shoes. That is to say, they commented on the lack of shoes to comment 
        on. Its been said many times before, but I feel that I have to say it 
        again once more. NO SHOES IN SNOW!! How does he do it? No one knows. Anyway, 
        after we hiked over the last of the ridges, we saw it laid out before 
        us. It was a big flat-bottomed groove cut into the mountains. At the end 
        it split and branched like the delta of a mighty river in reverse. At 
        the end of each split there was a glacier. Yup, you guessed it, Six of 
        em. We looked at them for a while and then took some pictures. After that 
        it was time to start heading back.<br>
        On the way back, we stopped at the second teahouse and had snacks. After 
        that it was a smooth downhill hike back to the bottom of the lake were 
        the parking lot was. A day well spent in Canada. 5 out of 5 &#147;Dan

        we stayed at while otherwise clean</p>

      <p style='text-align:justify;'>and welcoming had electric fences going around 
        the entire perimeter. While it is true that bears are considered a danger 
        in that area I think that the fence was a bit extreme. </p>
      <p>The Boardwalks<br>
        The first was a half-day hike through a swamp of reeds, berries and predominantly 
        Skunk Cabbage. The hike was quite enjoyable and the weather was quite 
        agreeable through the entire thing. The boardwalk was well built and sturdy. 
        The swamp was filled with wildlife from mayflies to frogs and fish. Near 
        the end we even saw a black bear with its cub, which at short range was 
        very cool. It was probably only 20 feet away from us but surprisingly 
        didn&#146;t seem to be very scared of us and simply left after a while. 
        The boardwalk had interesting and instructive signs at regular intervals. 
        Unfortunately in this case the emphasis was on had. A resident grizzly 
        named &#147;Macy&#148; had smashed most of them to pieces some years earlier 
        and they had not been replaced yet. This Hike was &#147;short but sweet&#148; 
        as the saying goes. 4 out of five &#147;Dan stars&#148;</p>
      <p> The second of the boardwalk hikes was through the forest. This one was 
        much shorter and lasted only 45 minutes. It was full of enormous trees 
        and a pleasant mossy smell. There were many fully intact instructive signs 
        that were pretty interesting. This hike didn&#146;t have a bear so in 
        my opinion needed a little extra wildlife. A bit to short and no bear.

      <p>Radium hot springs<br>
        This is the only event in the third week that was not a hike. To put it 
        simply, an absolutely massive hot tub! The Radium Hot Springs is a giant 
        heated pool. We spent several hours splashing around in this luxury, letting 
        out aches and pains of the last few days just soak away and leave us in 
        a contented stupor. A morning very well spent in Canada indeed. </p>

      and then got slammed against a large sandbar that caused a large amount 
      of spray up into the air. We hiked down to the river&#146;s side to get 
      a closer look. Once there we began to throw and skip stones. We amused ourselves 
      in this fashion for about 15 minutes and then went back up. An interesting 
      spectacle and some good clean fun.

        Avalanche Canyon<br>
        This hike was one of our favorites. It was a most of the day hike that 
        took 5 hours including the stop for lunch. We hiked up the middle of the 
        canyon for several hours until we came to the end. We then zigged and 
        zagged our way through snow up to the top of the ridge. The view was spectacular 
        and we could clearly see our campsite from where we were. We ate lunch 
        and stayed up there for about 45 minutes. Then we headed down. On the 
        way down Derek hallucinated about seeing an ermine and we teased him about 
        that for a bit. Definitely a good crisp hike.</p>
      <p><br>
        Paint Pots<br>
        This was one of the most interesting hikes. We walked through an area 
        of semi-defoliated land that was coated in yellow dust and mud. We learned 
        that Indians who often traveled for many miles had used this clay. In 
        more recent times, the clay was mined and used for yellow paints. The 
        scenery of the area was very interesting and I found it oddly disquieting 
        how most of the plants looked like they were yellow and dead but still 
        growing. However the hike was really only a short jaunt and hardly filled 
        up an hour. </p>
      <p><br>
        Marble canyon: <br>
        This sight was on the same day as the Indian clay hike. We walked a short 
        distance to a canyon that was filled with giant blocks of water-polished 
        marble and a small stream. While it was pretty to look at it wasn&#146;t 
        anything special</p>

        Mt. Revelstoke<br>
        We began this hike in the midmorning chill at the top of the mountain. 
        We hiked a small loop of the area and saw a few small furry woodland creatures. 
        After a while, we made our way to the top of the mountain that we were 
        on. Occupying the very top was a small abandoned fire tower that made 
        for a few good pictures. Brian took one of his panoramic pictures and 
        we made our way down again. It was an invigorating start for the day. 
        After we got down we went into one of the small lunch tables and had lunch 
        to a spectacular view. Definitely a good start to the day.</p>
      <p>Iceline Trail<br>
        This was one of our all day hikes. We started at the bottom of a U shaped 
        valley between two mountain ranges. We hiked up the slope zigzagging our 
        way up for well over an hour. We then came to a more or less flat area 
        with another higher range farther on and a whole lot of little glaciers 
        in the corners where the land sloped up again. We started to see lots 
        of snow and walked through quite a lot of it. After passing a large glacier-melt 
        pool, we ate lunch on a stony rise. After lunch, we continued to hike 
        horizontally to the upper mountain range. After about a half-hour of that, 
        we started back down the mountain. We had fun on the way down by throwing 
        snowballs we had scooped out of the occasional patches of snow at each 
        other. After we reached the bottom, we crossed the main road that we had 
        come in on and went to the opposite end of the valley. There we visited 
        a tall and powerful waterfall, Takakkaw Falls, that, because of an outcropping 
        of rock fell for a short ways and then shot out and up into the air. This 
        caused an enormous amount of spray and looked cool. We then hiked back 
        up the road to the car. Another worthwhile day. </p>
