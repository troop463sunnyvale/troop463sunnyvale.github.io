              <p>
                Many troops have New Scout Patrols, placing all the new scouts into a single patrol with an older scout as
                their guide. We have discovered that the "traditional" way of structuring the patrols works better for all the
                scouts. When new scouts join us they are placed into the existing patrols (along with a couple of their
                buddies from cub scouts). This provides the young scouts with role models and provides the older scouts with
                the opportunity to teach and guide the new scouts. It also helps to ensure that tasks get done.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another advantage of the traditional system is that the patrols are more equal in skills and abilities, making
                competitions and games more fair and exciting. Having only a couple young scouts provides an incentive for the
                experienced scouts to share their knowledge, and support the advancement of their whole patrol. Each patrol
                has 7-9 members. The patrols change a couple times a year to ensure that the patrols have a balance of all
                ranks, participation and personality compatibility. The number of Patrols that the Troop has is based on
                current members and the leadership strength of our older scouts.
