          The Anniversary Event took place on Saturday, September 27th was a great success.<br>
          We had close to 100 guests plus our current troop. Fun was had by all and old friendships rekindled.<br>
          We want to thank everyone for coming and hope we will see more of our alumni at the 50th.<br>

          As many of you know, we gathered stories and photos and created a Memory Book of the last 40 years. Stories from the first 25 years are woven together with the years that followed. I bet some of you don't even remember the stories you told back in 1993. It was fun to read and some of you, when asked again for stories, almost told the same stories... now that's leaving an impression.<br>
          <br>
          <h4><font>This 55+ page Memory Book includes:</font></h4>
          - Troop History<br>
          - Stories from all generations of the troop<br>

          - News articles about the troop<br>
