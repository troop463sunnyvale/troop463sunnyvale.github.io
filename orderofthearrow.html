          <h3>HEY!!!! YOU!!!! YES, YOU!!!!</h3>
          <p>
            The one thinking
            about joining our troop or are already in it and are looking here because
            you want to know the meaning of OA. Well&#133;it's a two-letter acronym&#133;that
            stands for&#133;Order of the Arrow. Sound pretty cool? In case you were
            wondering; we're NOT a band of carefree Boy Scouts who roam Sunnyvale and
            the surrounding cities stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. We
            don't do that but we do help the community in many ways through cheerful
            service. Oh, and you get to wear a cool sash with a red arrow on it&#133;definitely
            improving the Boy Scout uniform.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyhow, OA is an 'elite brotherhood' of
            Boy Scouts where you get to make new friends, have fun, and help out the
            community&#133;all in one package&#133;for FREE! If you're interested in
            joining OA&#133;then start working towards 1st Class (required for OA)&#133;and
            on your other scouts to vote for you when OA elections roll around in March.
            So start racing towards that not-that-elusive 1st Class badge&#133;and when
            March rolls around&#133;hey! Then you'll get to know the ultra-cool OA experience.
            As an added bonus, if you're elected as OA rep (like I am) then you'll get
            to miss one troop meeting per MONTH. But I'm sure whoever the next OA rep
            won't look forward to that part because we all love troop meetings, right?
