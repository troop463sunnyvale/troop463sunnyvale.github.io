                  rank. We also have Ed and me, Chris. Everyone in the KN patrol went to summer camp except Wesley.
                  Everyone got merit badges and Ed was the only person in the troop who got archery out of 6 people.</p>

                <p align="left"> It&rsquo;s finally the start of a new season of boy scouting, and I am pleased to
                  report that things are looking good now, even after our moderately shaky start. We say our goodbyes to
                  old scouts and our hellos to those who are new. The troop will be undergoing some reformations, and
                  reconfigurations. Brian and James will take over the positions as patrol leaders with a reorganized
                  troop to incorporate 2 patrols. Hopefully our new fist class scouts, Chris, Sean, and possibly a
                  couple others will be able to take on more diverse rolls in the troop that will enable them to
                  complete leadership position requirements for their next rank. I believe we have a good strategy to
                  accomplish any challenges that may arise. From there things should be running quite a bit more
                  smoothly, once the new positions are taken and our leaders continue to contribute their time. As for
                  the meetings themselves, it is my belief that we have a strong start and a have begun forming a
                  healthy habit regarding timeliness. <br>
                  The scouts are coming in strongly as well with their merit badges, and rank requirements. Although
                  there does seem to be a bit of a summer mind frame that hasn&rsquo;t yet been shaken off. The patrols
                  are lacking in areas that they had a firm grip on before the break of summer. With the aid of our new
                  leadership framework, there should be a noticeable step up in the quality, spirit and overall
                  enjoyment of our meetings to come. <br>
                  I look forward to seeing you all continue the good work.<br>

                    Brian</p>

                  <p align="left">This easy four-day backpacking trip was one of the most exciting and fun troop trips
                    in quite some time. After the insanely long drive to Tenaya Lake, we embarked on the hike to Polly
                    Dome Lake. The trail was fairly level, and at only four miles, was pretty short, yet still a lot of
                    people were fairly tired when we got there. The last mile was highly mosquito infested, and the last
                    half-mile was cross-country. The mosquitoes were very annoying, and, as always, the repellent seemed
                    ineffective. However the cross-country was very fun. There are twenty billion &ldquo;trails&rdquo;
                    leading from the real trail to the lake, but none of them seemed to go all the way, and they were
                    hard to follow and often just a slight depression in soft ground for a few feet, or a three ducks
                    spaced at a few hundred yards. Despite many people doubting that the lake existed, and being very
                    tired (for many it was there first backpacking trip) we soon got to the lake and set up camp. For
                    the rest of the day we basically did nothing, just rested or played in camp.<br>
                    The next day we decided to go to Polly Dome. Well, more precisely, my dad, Ms. Corley and I did. So
                    we asked the group who wanted to go, and none of the </p>

              </td>
              <td valign="middle">
                <div align="center">
                  <p align="left">new scouts wanted to go and Chris and Todd had been saying since the day before that
                    they didn&rsquo;t want to do anything but sleep all day. So we decided it&rsquo;d just be us three,
                    but wait, now Mr. Oatman decided he&rsquo;d go. So Todd changed his mind, which caused Chris to
                    change his mind, and Sean now wanted to go. His dad wanted to do what he did, so now no adults
                    wanted to stay behind, so everyone went (My heads spinning too). So we all set out through the
                    mosquito-infested woods up towards Polly Dome&rsquo;s summit. Again there was no trail, so all of it
                    was cross-country which is loads of fun. The hike was fairly short, probably less than three miles
                    round trip, but it was pretty steep and there was no trail. We soon got to a ridge where you could
                    see Half Dome and Clouds Rest, and we were just 600 vertical feet from the top (and 100 horizontal
                    feet ;-)) Some of the scouts decided it was too steep or that they were too tired, so only about
                    half of us continued up. It was very steep and very hard to find a route, but thirty minutes later
                    we reached the top and were rewarded with an awesome 360-degree view. We ate lunch (now, when I
                    say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, think those who brought it, and when I say that think only half of us). We
                    then took some more pictures and headed down. On the way down we had a nice slide down an insanely
                    steep snow shoot, and then, when re-united with the group, we had a couple of snowball fights (in
                    June!!!). We soon got back to camp and then some of us went swimming while some sat around doing
                    nothing.<br>
                    The third day we climbed Tuolumne Peak. Only four of us went, which probably had something to do
                    with Todd getting sick. This hike was much longer at about five miles each way, although most of it
                    was on a trail. There was also quite a bit of elevation gain. The previous day had threatened rain,
                    so we were in a hurry to beat it. When we finally got to the pass, Chris, my dad, and I continued on
                    to the top. We didn&rsquo;t pick the best route, and it took us a while, but we did see a deer
                    running across the snow, which was pretty fun. When we got to the top, it wasn&rsquo;t. Let me
                    elaborate, when we reached where we were aiming for, we discovered that we&rsquo;d missed and that
                    the top was a much more gradual climb (a mound of rocks instead of a big pillar of them. We were
                    kind of disappointed by this, but were encouraged by the fact that our mistake allowed us what was

                  (due to where we now stood being in the way). We could also see Poly Dome, which was kind of funny
                  since it looked like a little mound of granite, about a tenth the size of where we now were. After
                  lunch and pictures, we started down, determined to beat the rain to camp. We got back to camp fairly
                  late and didn&rsquo;t have time to go swimming, and it was still threatening rain, but as the evening
                  progressed the clouds disappeared. As we were making dinner, or, more accurately cleaning it up, I saw
                  a bear behind Sean. I calmly pointed this out to him, and he thought I was joking. I finally got him
                  to turn around, and boy was he surprised to see a bear a only about twenty feet behind him. I went and
                  got my camera (and so did a bunch of other people) and we all proceeded to shoot the bear until it got
                  too camera shy and left. For many of the scouts, this was the first bear they&rsquo;d ever seen, and
                  finally knew for sure that bears weren&rsquo;t just a government conspiracy. We didn&rsquo;t see it
                  again. We made double sure that our food was secure, and then we went back to messing around.<br>
                  The following day, we packed up and hiked out, got in the car and drove home stopping for fast food on
                  the way (I love fast food). As we drove out, we saw the rain clouds building again, and this time it
                  actually looked like it was raining where we had been camping. And thus was concluded our wonderful
                  backpack trip!</p></td>

                  sun was out every day and there were no rain clouds. There was a lot of variety of what merit badges
                  people took, from camping to woodcarving. Some eagle required, some not. Over all, everyone who went
                  got at least 1 merit badge. Some even got 4. In the Olimpicade, Ed got 3rd in Chris&rsquo;s Big Bad
                  Archery Tournament and Chris and Matt got third in the Regatta. Justin got the most improved shooter
                  in rifle and got the rifle merit badge. Again, we got the Navaho campsite and had to share it with

                <p>You might remember me once saying during the announcements that everyone was to show up at the church
                  for this outing at 7 AM sharp, that way we can get this outing started in a timely manner. It was 7:05
                  in the morning when I arrived at the church, reasonably early when compared with my previous
                  reputation. However that&rsquo;s a different story all together. This story begins with me, hoping
                  against hope that at least one other senior scout would be there at the church, to great me non-too
                  sarcastically, and crack jokes about my being on time for once. Unfortunately as it turns out, that
                  one candidate just so happen to have a reputation of his own. I wont go into detail, suffice it to
                  say, he didn&rsquo;t show up.<br>
                  &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; I thought to myself &ldquo;at least there&rsquo;s this long car ride where I
                  might be able to catch some shuteye. Wow!!! (&szlig; 3 exclamation marks) was I wrong about that!
                  Little did I know, but I happened to end up in the car with quite possibly the two loudest, non-stop
                  kids of them all. That may have been the longest car ride I have ever been on. What a better way to
                  start an outing all on one&rsquo;s own, than to begin it exhausted and frustrated? (James if you ever
                  read this, I promise I will never leave you alone on an outing again). Aside from </p></td>
              <td valign="top">
                <p align="left">some minor complications with the campsite arrangements, the morning went pretty
                  smoothly. In fact we were able to get onto the beach by around one o&rsquo;clock.<br>
                  The boys had a load of fun just body surfing, boogie boarding, digging in the sand, and skim boarding.
                  I managed to get in some skim boarding myself, (although for the first time), and found it
                  astonishingly appealing. It didn&rsquo;t even take me more than a couple of hours to get the hang of
                  it. <br>
                  We all found the beach quite warm and pleasantly sunny. Although the ocean held a crisp contrast, as
                  it was quite cold and invigorating. This provided us a rather relaxing and yet intensely excellent
                  experience. As it turns out, we lucked out entirely, in regards to the weather. Apparently this
                  weekend had been the clearest they&rsquo;ve experienced for quite some time.<br>
                  At about four thirty, we headed back to the campsite and broke up into groups to work on advancement.
                  If I remember correctly, I may have overheard a couple of the boys saying they had accomplished
                  excellent progress towards their ranks. At about five thirty, we started dinner, and had a fairly
                  relaxed evening (well, as far as relaxed goes on a trip like this one). Later that evening, the
                  leading scouts held a meeting to discuss the plans for the next day&rsquo;s activities.<br>
                  The next day we were supposed to wake up at around seven. However, I was unceremoniously prodded awake
                  at about 6:45 in the morning to be told that some things were stolen, including a backpack. However,
                  this scout who had awakened me and had his things stolen had been warned numerous times about such a
                  possibility. (The campgrounds even had a sign that stated that they were not to be held responsible if
                  anything was to go missing, and that such occurrences have happened in the past). The tail continues
                  as well. Later, I found out that during the night, the boys who had some things taken had had their
                  tent collapsed while they were sleeping, and were woken up by it. It just so happened that the reason
                  for this was because their backpacks were being used as a means to hold down a rope to secure their
                  tent pole to. They did not decide to investigate the tents collapse, and thus the culprit was able to
                  get away with much of their belongings. (However, our camp was not the only camp that suffered from
                  this misfortune and the belongings were recovered by </p></td>

                  After breakfast, we headed down to the Museum of Natural History. There we spent about an hour and a
                  half of a thrilling educational experience. We learned much about the estuaries and Morro Rock, along
                  with the mountain range (or rather the volcano range) it belongs to, including Cabrillo, which we had
                  planned our hike on. We had lunch after that, fallowed by a frustrating three to four mile hike up to
                  the beautiful and gusty peak of Cabrillo. I refer to it as frustrating due to conditions prompted by
                  the ill preparedness of many of the scouts. About one third of them did not take an ample supply of
                  water on this hike, regardless of the previous advice and warnings. That aside, the hike itself was
                  truly an adventure; with its outstanding rocky peak, and picture perfect view. Aside from the heat and
                  lack of water, we had a quite pleasant hike.<br>
                  Once recovered from the hike, all the scouts wanted to do was hit the cool waters of the North
                  Pacific. It was just a cool stretch of fun and play from there until dinnertime. After dinner and a
                  beautiful sunset, many scouts went to bed or discussed what was to be done the next day in order to
                  get up and out of there with still one last stop at the beach. Over all, the last day went pretty
                  well, although it still takes us some time to clean up our tents and breakfast. However, I&rsquo;m
                  sure we have greatly improved, we just didn&rsquo;t have enough senior scouts on this outing to really
                  hold it together. So if there is a lesson to be learned from all of this, it&rsquo;s that when scouts
                  stick together, things will always turn out better.<br>

                  ceremony such a success. It wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without YOU!<br>
                  All of the scouts did a great job and we appreciate you being there and helping with either the flags,
                  Eagle escort, or as a speaker or all of the above. Senior Scouts, thank you for having such great
                  scout spirit and taking on so many reading roles. Derek, your interruption could not have been better.
                  Brian seemed quite surprised and so cool to think he had one on you when the justification came
                  through. But the protest continued and I&rsquo;m sure Brian had no idea as to when they were going to
                  stop. Great job, all of you! Thank you James for the Eagle Poem. I&rsquo;m sure all the Eagles present
                  appreciated it. Also, thank you Aaron for participating as much as you did. Everyone did fantastic and
                  it is hard to thank you enough! It was really fun to have all of you participating.<br>
                  Dave, you were great as the MC! So natural up there and great at being surprised by those many
                  interruptions&hellip; Thank you so much. We appreciate the advice that you and other Eagle Scout
                  Leaders gave, to help make the ceremony perfect.<br>
