        <p>
          In Troop 463, we believe the purpose of Boy Scouts is threefold: to have fun, to learn skills, but most
          importantly, to become a better person through strong character development. Our adults and senior scouts
          emphasize that Scouting is not just about becoming an Eagle quickly but instead to develop real life skills in
          the process. Working through the Trail to Eagle is about building character not just putting forth a minimal
          effort. We encourage our scouts to always strive to put in their best effort and to develop pride in their
          accomplishments, whether that is in mastering a knot or leading their patrol in advancement and troop spirit. In
          the words of our Scoutmaster, "the rank badge is just a piece of cloth, it is the work required to achieve it
          that counts". We feel proud to say that our Eagle Scouts truly represent what achieving the Rank of Eagle
          encompasses.
        </p>

        <h3>First</h3>
        We consider fun as one key part of Boy Scouts and our Troop. If Scouts are having fun, they will keep coming and
        growing as individuals and they will be more motivated to participate in all aspects of the program. All of our
        teaching is hands-on and led by our older scouts. We have outings every month, and we include games and
        competitions at every meeting. We have a "traditional" troop structure with each patrol being made up of all ranks
        and ages. Therefore, all of the scouts have ample opportunities to interact and enjoy themselves while learning
        new skills. Being Scout lead makes the leadership open to suggestions from any scout, with the goal of the Troop
        being Fun for all.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Second</h3>
        We emphasize the learning of outdoor skills, such as cooking, camping, knot-tying, hiking, first aid, swimming,
        fire-building, conservation and service. At meetings, the leadership, consisting of experienced scouts first class
        and above, teach the younger scouts the basic skills necessary to enjoy the outdoors. While the prospect of
        earning ranks may serve as an incentive to learning, signing off requirements is the by-product as the scouts
        build character by working hard and doing their best, instead of just what is written in the handbook.

        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Third</h3>
        We believe that the true purpose of participating in Scouting is to grow as a person, to learn leadership skills
        and develop self-confidence and perseverance in everything we do. For example, before a scout becomes a First
        Class, he is taught, and the older scouts help guide him to achieve his full potential in learning; teaching him,
        and helping him cope with failure. However, after a scout is First Class, the true learning begins. He learns and
        experiences teaching skills, taking initiative, establishing discipline, and leading his peers and the younger
        scouts. This is where the true fulfillment in Boy Scouts is; the immense pride, self-esteem, and growth gained
        along the trail to Eagle is infinitely more valuable than the badge itself
