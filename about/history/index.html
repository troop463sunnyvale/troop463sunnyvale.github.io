    </header><p>In the year 1968 Boy Scout Troop 463 was born.</p>
<p>A retired reverend, Daniel Lindstrom and a group of parents who wanted to create positive activities for the youth in our area helped form Troop 463. From 1969 to 1972 Chuck McRery served as our second scoutmaster. The person who sewed the first batch of neckerchiefs was Mrs. Marilou Prasek. We are proud that this original design is still worn by our scouts today. During the early years of our troops origin our Whadachoo cheer was created. Our current Scoutmaster, Brian Davis has been the ScoutMaster since 2017 and brings his passion of the outdoors and his desire to see all the scouts achieve the highest of standards in the scouting program.</p>
<p>Our Troop has some favorite summer camps, but tries to visit a new camp every other year so that summer camp remains exciting during all their scouting years. Our troop outings offer a range of experiences and new ideas for outing are always welcomed. The older scouts plan the calendar every year and like to visit new places and try new activities. Our older scouts get additional opportunities. They have participated in National and World Jamborees, BSA High Adventure Base Camps, multi-day backpacking trips and our own unique Travel Trips. Our troop has a &ldquo;History&rdquo; and during that time has seen 59 boys earn the Rank of Eagle Scout., #60 is just about done! We look forward to seeing many more Eagles in the future.</p>
<p>We have the luxury of being able to provide much of the Troop gear for outings such as tents and cooking supplies. Only personal items will be needed.</p>
