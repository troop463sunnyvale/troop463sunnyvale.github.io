      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Troop 463, we believe the purpose of Boy Scouts is threefold: to have fun, to learn skills, but most importantly, to become a better person through strong character development. Our adults and senior scouts emphasize that Scouting is not just about becoming an Eagle quickly but instead to develop real life skills in the process. Working through the Trail to Eagle is about building character not just putting forth a minimal effort. We encourage our scouts to always strive to put in their best effort and to develop pride in their accomplishments, whether that is in mastering a knot or leading their patrol in advancement and troop spirit. In the words of our Scoutmaster, &amp;ldquo;the rank badge is just a piece of cloth, it is the work required to achieve it that counts&amp;rdquo;. We feel proud to say that our Eagle Scouts truly represent what achieving the Rank of Eagle encompasses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each month, the leadership of Troop 463 gathers for the Patrol Leaders&amp;rsquo; Council to plan, among other things, the next month&amp;rsquo;s meetings, and any major outing that are coming up. Troop 463 has regular meetings during the school calendar months. Aug ? June. We meet Tuesday evenings from 7:30 to 9:00, with a pre-meeting and post-meeting for the leadership only. Therefore, we can incorporate a wide variety of activities within the 90 minutes, while still having an organized structure. During the off months, we may be off enjoying summer camp, or either on or prepping for a High Adventure trip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many troops have New Scout Patrols, placing all the new scouts into a single patrol with an older scout as their guide. We have discovered that the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; way of structuring the patrols works better for all the scouts. When new scouts join us they are placed into the existing patrols (along with a couple of their buddies from cub scouts). This provides the young scouts with role models and provides the older scouts with the opportunity to teach and guide the new scouts. It also helps to ensure that tasks get done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>High Advanture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Troop 463&amp;rsquo;s high adventure program provides the experienced Scouts an extra benefit that goes beyond our regular events and outings. While the main troop&amp;rsquo;s outings are a lot of fun, they must be structured for all of the Scouts. However, since the High Adventure group is composed of the older, more experienced Scouts, we can go on almost any adventure imaginable. To participate in the High Adventure group, the scout has to attain the rank of 1st Class before the trip and be willing to try new things that may challenge their comfort zone!! like having a fear of heights!! But still participating in a High Rope Challenge Course. Being First Class, allows the High Adventure group to go on more adventurous and more fun outings since everyone has the basic skills of scouting. Occasionally, activities we choose will also have age restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the year 1968 Boy Scout Troop 463 was born.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A retired reverend, Daniel Lindstrom and a group of parents who wanted to create positive activities for the youth in our area helped form Troop 463. From 1969 to 1972 Chuck McRery served as our second scoutmaster. The person who sewed the first batch of neckerchiefs was Mrs. Marilou Prasek. We are proud that this original design is still worn by our scouts today. During the early years of our troops origin our Whadachoo cheer was created. Our current Scoutmaster, Brian Davis has been the ScoutMaster since 2017 and brings his passion of the outdoors and his desire to see all the scouts achieve the highest of standards in the scouting program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the 50+ years Troop 463 has had involved parents and excellent fund raising. Although Boy Scouts is a Boy Lead? program, a troop can not be successful without the full involvement from the parents, committed other adults, good fundraising and of course eager participation from the scouts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fundraising&#34;&gt;FUNDRAISING&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our Troop does not sell Popcorn to earn funds (although we may do this to support the High Adventure program or for individual scouts to earn money towards their scout activities). We have two major events that cover all our troop expenses. Hands on the Arts (May) and Art and Wine (1st weekend of June).&#xA;Hands on the Art is a Saturday event. Our scouts sell ice cream and water. Working this event helps promote our troop and gets our scouts out into the community. Adults are essential to assist with the set up and sales support. Shift are usually only a couple hours and a lot of fun! Earnings at this event are very contingent on good weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
