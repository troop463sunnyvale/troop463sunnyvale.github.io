    </header><p>In Troop 463, we believe the purpose of Boy Scouts is threefold: to have fun, to learn skills, but most importantly, to become a better person through strong character development. Our adults and senior scouts emphasize that Scouting is not just about becoming an Eagle quickly but instead to develop real life skills in the process. Working through the Trail to Eagle is about building character not just putting forth a minimal effort. We encourage our scouts to always strive to put in their best effort and to develop pride in their accomplishments, whether that is in mastering a knot or leading their patrol in advancement and troop spirit. In the words of our Scoutmaster, &ldquo;the rank badge is just a piece of cloth, it is the work required to achieve it that counts&rdquo;. We feel proud to say that our Eagle Scouts truly represent what achieving the Rank of Eagle encompasses.</p>
<h3 id="first">First</h3>
<p>We consider fun as one key part of Boy Scouts and our Troop. If Scouts are having fun, they will keep coming and growing as individuals and they will be more motivated to participate in all aspects of the program. All of our teaching is hands-on and led by our older scouts. We have outings every month, and we include games and competitions at every meeting. We have a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; troop structure with each patrol being made up of all ranks and ages. Therefore, all of the scouts have ample opportunities to interact and enjoy themselves while learning new skills. Being Scout lead makes the leadership open to suggestions from any scout, with the goal of the Troop being Fun for all.</p>
<h3 id="second">Second</h3>
<p>We emphasize the learning of outdoor skills, such as cooking, camping, knot-tying, hiking, first aid, swimming, fire-building, conservation and service. At meetings, the leadership, consisting of experienced scouts first class and above, teach the younger scouts the basic skills necessary to enjoy the outdoors. While the prospect of earning ranks may serve as an incentive to learning, signing off requirements is the by-product as the scouts build character by working hard and doing their best, instead of just what is written in the handbook.</p>
<h3 id="third">Third</h3>
<p>We believe that the true purpose of participating in Scouting is to grow as a person, to learn leadership skills and develop self-confidence and perseverance in everything we do. For example, before a scout becomes a First Class, he is taught, and the older scouts help guide him to achieve his full potential in learning; teaching him, and helping him cope with failure. However, after a scout is First Class, the true learning begins. He learns and experiences teaching skills, taking initiative, establishing discipline, and leading his peers and the younger scouts. This is where the true fulfillment in Boy Scouts is; the immense pride, self-esteem, and growth gained along the trail to Eagle is infinitely more valuable than the badge itself</p>
