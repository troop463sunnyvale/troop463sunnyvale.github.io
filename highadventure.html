            Troop 463's high adventure program provides the experienced Scouts an extra benefit that goes beyond our
            regular events and outings. While the main troop's outings are a lot of fun, they must be structured for all
            of the Scouts. However, since the High Adventure group is composed of the older, more experienced Scouts, we
            can go on almost any adventure imaginable. To participate in the High Adventure group, the scout has to
            attain the rank of 1st Class before the trip and be willing to try new things that may challenge their
            comfort zone!! like having a fear of heights!! But still participating in a High Rope Challenge Course. Being
            First Class, allows the High Adventure group to go on more adventurous and more fun outings since everyone
            has the basic skills of scouting. Occasionally, activities we choose will also have age restrictions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Travel Trips that our Troop does are a unique opportunity to see beyond California. Where we go (Alaska,
            Canada, etc), What we do (Ice Climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, and of course backpacking) is decided and
            planned by the Scouts that are participating in the trip. Although the Scoutmaster always adds a 4 day
            backpack trip or the HA-ASM may suggest something we haven't considered or maybe occasionally have to veto a
            very cool idea due to 'rules', it is all up to the Scouts who will be participating as to what is done on
            these travel trips. They are pretty awesome!!
          </p>

          <p>
            The High Adventure group can also go on additional weekend or day trips. If a member wants to do an
            activity, they just need to convince the rest of the older Scouts and our High Adventure ASM will help us
            make it happen! Some examples of these are: Spelunking, Mountain Biking, or Rock Climbing.
          </p>

          <p>
            As First Class Scouts, we can also go to the BSA Scout Bases like Philmont, Seabase and Northern Tier and
            participate in National and World Jamborees. A lot of extra adventures await the 'trained' scout.
